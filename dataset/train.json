A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and\n superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma,\n measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density\n fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.\n\n The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive\n atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at\n this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and\n likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around\n the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or\n transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great\n vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left\n vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left\n common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and\n airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular\n aneurysm or rupture.\n\n Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous\n changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left\n pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent\n atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the\n lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).\n There is no pneumothorax.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of\n the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,\n and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic duct is top normal in\n caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in\n the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of\n intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are\n bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring\n 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.\n\n There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is\n tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures\n up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic\n change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,\n these vessels and their major branches appear patent.\n\n CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present\n within the prostate gland, which is enlarged.  The urinary bladder is\n distended with contrast.  There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of\n a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or\n obstruction.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are numerous sigmoid\n diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  Wedge deformity of the L2 vertebral body is probably chronic.\n There is bilateral spondylolysis at L5 with associated grade 1 anterolisthesis\n of L5 over S1.",

The right upper arm was prepped\n and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout\n were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.\n\n Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was\n punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard\n copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing\n intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.\n There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right\n subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The\n venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with\n extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018\n guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4\n French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal\n SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film\n of the chest.\n\n The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was\n secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient\n tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.\n\n Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line\n was removed.  A sterile dressing was again applied.",

There is no separation of\n bowel loops, no abnormal mucosal thickening or enhancement.  No persistent\n strictures.  No mesenteric adenopathy.  Evaluation of the large bowel is\n somewhat limited by the residual fecal material; however, no gross\n abnormalities are seen except to note sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence\n of diverticulitis.  No free fluid.\n\n The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys are\n unremarkable.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  Visualized bone marrow is\n normal.  Incidental note is made of a splenule in the left upper quadrant.\n The prostate gland is moderately enlarged measuring 4.7 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm,\n yielding a calculated prostate volume of 49.7 cm3.

Right apical radiation\n  fibrosis and right mastectomy noted. Dense atherosclerotic calcification of\n  the aorta and all of its branches most likely due to severe hypercalcemia.\n  Lytic and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, vertebrae, ribs with soft tissue\n  calcification of the anterior chest wall.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, in another institution,\n recurrent chylothorax, repeated right pleural aspirates positive for\n triglycerides.  Left pleural effusion not aspirated.  Evaluate for\n lymphadenopathy.  Background of right mastectomy, right chest radiation and\n thyroidectomy.  Mild chronic renal impairment.  Low serum calcium, elevated\n serum phosphate.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was\n performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for\n display in the axial plane at 1.25- and 5-mm collimation.  A series of\n multiplanar reformation images are also submitted for review.\n\n FINDINGS:  No prior CT is available for comparison.\n The patient has had a right mastectomy.  The thyroid is absent.  Mixed lytic\n and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, both anterior first ribs, medial\n clavicles, and many of the thoracic vertebrae are extensive, there is\n associated soft tissue calcification anterior to the right sternoclavicular\n joint.  The thoracic spine is scoliotic.  Exuberant calcification of the\n thoracic and abdominal aorta, the innominate, left common carotid, and left\n subclavian artery origins, coronary arteries, and the right renal artery\n ostium is markedly severe.  A left pleural effusion is moderately large.  The\n right pleural effusion shown on the chest radiograph dated [**2184-8-3**] has\n completely resolved after chest drain insertion (2, 44), its side hole is\n within the pleural cavity.  Linear scarring in the medial aspect of the right\n upper lobe (2:14), most likely represents prior radiation therapy and\n subsequent cicatricial atelectasis.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower\n lobe is moderately severe.  Ground glass attenuation of the left lung is of\n uncertain significance and could represent lymphatic obstruction, as the\n function of the moderately large left pleural effusion.  The airways are\n patent to the subsegmental level.\n The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The upper\n esophagus is mildly dilated, which places patient at an increased risk of\n aspiration.  A focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess may\n represent calcified adenopathy.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of\n the upper abdomen, only to confirm normal-appearing adrenal glands and the\n absence of upper abdominal ascites.",

Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 753**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 754**], the\n attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.\n\n ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a\n total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were\n continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered\n lidocaine.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:\n\n An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,\n benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the\n angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen\n was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and\n timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.\n\n A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was\n insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under\n fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge\n was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three\n T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the\n anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.\n A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge\n needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The\n position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.\n The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a\n 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed\n and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after\n confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter\n was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.\n The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate\n complications.",

Evaluate the carotid arteries.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.\n\n FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior\n parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring\n approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The\n hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the\n facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to\n have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral\n sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or\n overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also\n subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well\n as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of\n possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This\n finding was not seen on the prior study.\n\n CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE\n HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar\n reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.\n\n FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the\n internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal\n internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder\n right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of\n the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears\n patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a\n dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is\n more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite\n additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation\n are present at this time.",

The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal\n intensity.  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small\n (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural\n effusions.  The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were\n identified in their customary positions.  The diameters of the ascending\n aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal.  The left\n atrial AP dimension was mildly increased.  The left atrial dimensions in the\n 4-chamber view was mildly increased.\n The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged.  The left\n ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated.  The\n calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%,\n with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global\n hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of\n the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricular mass was normal.\n The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated\n right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional\n and global systolic function.\n The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.\n\n Quantitative Flow\n There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no\n significant aortic regurgitation.  There was no significant mitral\n regurgitation.  The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow\n demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n Viability\n There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal\n portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral\n segments, and the apex.   The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with\n poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.\n  The infarct/LV mass ratio was 0.33.",

There is a\n 5 x 3 x 4 mm echogenic lesion with shadowing consistent with calcification\n which is present just medial to the middle hepatic veins.  There is no\n increased vascularity or soft tissue mass in this region.  No other hepatic\n calcifications are identified.  Normal flow is seen within the portal veins\n and hepatic veins.\n\n The right kidney measures 4.7 cm in length and appears normal.  The left\n kidney was not visualized.  The urinary bladder is almost empty.\n\n The spleen is normal in size.  The pancreas was not visualized secondary to\n gas.\n\n Both adrenal glands are seen.\n\n There is no abdominal or pelvic ascites.\n\n No thrombus is seen in the inferior vena cava.",

The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV\n team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced\n centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request\n was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip\n positioned centrally.\n\n CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the\n attending radiologist, reviewed the study.\n\n ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the\n procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the\n existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.\n\n Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline\n catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either\n aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were\n unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the\n wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a\n small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating\n the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new\n access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and\n ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A\n 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the\n wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small\n amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the\n level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture\n sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe\n catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC\n line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed\n over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in\n length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the\n SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then\n removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.\n The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings\n were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.\n The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate\n complications.",

There is a small\n cyst in the left renal mid-pole.  There is no significant retroperitoneal\n lymph node enlargement.\n\n There is a very large ventral hernia containing small bowel and colon.  There\n is no luminal distension or mural thickening to suggest obstruction or\n incarceration.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The ureters, bladder, uterus and rectum are normal.\n There is no free fluid.\n\n The skeletal structures are unremarkable.\n\n CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Images reformatted in the coronal plane demonstrate\n contrast within non-distended small bowel loops in the ventral hernia. The\n renal collecting systems are patent and non-dilated.",

Initial spot fluoroscopic image.\n 2.  Removal of existing malpositioned nasogastric tube.\n 3.  Placement of a 5 French catheter into the stomach.\n 4.  Placement of a 12 French percutaneous Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] gastrostomy tube and 3\n T-tacks.\n 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.\n\n MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV\n Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which\n continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient\n received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.\n\n PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was\n obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of\n procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial\n fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube\n malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and\n under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used\n to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.\n Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was\n insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine\n administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was\n deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two\n additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used\n to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced.  Sequential\n fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French\n Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube.  The pigtail was formed within the stomach.  Contrast\n injection confirmed location.  The T-tacks were secured to the skin with 0\n silk suture.  A dressing was applied.  The patiet tolerated the procedure well\n and left the IR suite in good condition.",

[The noncontrast CT images\n are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of\n overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose\n level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area\n imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.\n\n Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET\n images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The\n determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important\n implications regarding the significance of that uptake.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n\n HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components\n arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the\n level of the mandible.

The previous dictation has been lost\n during the process of transcription.\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY:\n 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures\n bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns\n bilaterally.\n\n TECHNIQUE:\n Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after\n explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained\n included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with\n possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.\n\n The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and\n placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and\n draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery\n was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using\n 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.\n Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken\n out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a\n saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a\n continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced\n and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of\n heparin in 1000 cc of saline).\n\n The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were\n performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal\n carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.\n\n LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:\n No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.\n\n LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:\n There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal\n carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small\n aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and\n appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.\n\n LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:\n There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.\n There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,\n basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.\n\n The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be\n catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's\n breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels\n under general anesthesia.",

Now pain, fever and white count elevation.\n Assess for interval change.\n\n COMPARISON:  Multiple CT abdomen and pelvis with latest on [**2193-8-29**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic\n symphysis after only administration of oral contrast.  No IV contrast was\n administered secondary to patient's acute renal failure.  Multiplanar\n reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  The visualized lung bases are clear\n without pleural effusions.  The absence of IV contrast significantly limits\n evaluation of intra-abdominal organs.  The liver is noted with a geographic\n hypodensity in segment V, incompletely assessed, but grossly unchanged\n compared to the study 7 days ago.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal\n dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted with small amount of hyperdense material\n layering in the dependent portion, compatible with gallstone.  There is no CT\n evidence of acute cholecystitis.  The adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen is\n grossly unremarkable.  The splenic vein is markedly calcified.\n\n Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is moderate-to-severe but relatively unchanged\n in severity compared to prior.  The stomach, duodenum and proximal loops of\n small bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is free oral contrast passage\n through and reaching up to the mid descending colon.  There is no free air or\n air in the intra-abdominal cavity.\n\n CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is marked interval increase and spread\n of subcutaneous air along the left posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with\n interval aggressive necrosis of the underlying soft tissues.  Hyperdense\n material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64,\n concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent\n bowel.  Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also\n suggestive of microperforation.  There is no definite bowel obstruction.\n Colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant.  The large collection of\n soft tissue and fluid is again noted in the mid pelvis, amorphous and\n difficult to assess the boundary.  The asymmetrically enlarged left psoas\n muscle, incompletely evaluated without IV contrast, either represent an\n intramuscular mass or abscess.\n\n BONE WINDOW:  There is no definite bony erosion.  No suspicious lytic or\n sclerotic lesions are noted.",

Coronal and sagittal\n reformatted images were obtained.\n\n CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph\n nodes are noted, mostly not meeting CT criteria for pathological enlargement,\n largest in the subcarinal station measuring 15 mm in the short axis diameter.\n No pathologic axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent to\n the subsegmental levels bilaterally. There are bilateral patchy ground-glass\n opacities in the lower lobes, as well as diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2085**] nodules,\n including lingula, both lower lobes.  Mild bronchiectasis is noted in the\n lower lobes bilaterally.\n\n There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Dense calcifications of the\n coronary arteries are noted.\n\n Again noted multiple hypoattenuating foci in the parenchyma, overall size and\n distribution are unchanged from the prior study.  Cholelithiasis, without\n evidence of acute cholecystitis.  Small amount of abdominal ascites, mostly\n perihepatic, as well as tracking along the right paracolic gutter.

No IV contrast was administered due to patient's\n allergy.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.\n\n CT CHEST:  Coronary and aortic calcifications are identified.  The heart size\n is normal.  There is prominent axillary and mediastinal adenopathy.  There are\n bilateral nodular and consolidative opacities, most prominently involving the\n lower lobes in a dependent fashion.  Small opacities and consolidation were\n also noted in the right middle lobe.  There are no pleural or pericardial\n effusions.  A nasogastric tube is coiled within the mid esophagus.\n\n CT ABDOMEN:  Within the limits of this study without contrast, the liver,\n gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel\n loops are within normal limits.  There is no free air or free fluid.  No\n mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.  There does\n appear to be some mesenteric stranding however the evaluation is quite limited\n by the lack of abdominal fat.\n\n CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder.  There are\n prostatic and vascular calcifications.  The sigmoid colon and rectum are\n unremarkable.  The appendix is normal.  There is no free fluid and no pelvic\n or inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.",

          "context": "FINAL REPORT\n CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until\n several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting\n decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine\n infarctions which have essentially left him near \"locked-in\".  On\n [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of\n narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term\n conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and\n his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed\n extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the\n treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).\n\n PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are\n explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the\n consent form.\n\n The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under\n general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian\n approach, radial A line is present.\n\n The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard\n Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.\n Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely\n tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed\n over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.\n Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French\n [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard\n Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:\n\n The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid\n artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections\n utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter\n is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the\n head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates\n filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal\n collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial\n atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.\n\n Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.\n Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and\n lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is\n a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on\n this left side.\n\n Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left\n vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.\n Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral\n positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete\n 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access\n arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this\n examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The\n distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior\n inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.\n\n Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection\n and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff\n placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to\n terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the\n vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not\n enter the vertebral.\n\n The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of\n Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at\n this point.\n\n The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.\n The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU.",

Dr.\n [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and  reviewed the study.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the\n procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The\n potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and\n confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and\n placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and\n indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual\n sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]\n protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a\n micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a\n 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a\n 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected\n and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire\n with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the\n skin with 0 silk suture.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated well.  A\n final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and\n no pneumothorax.\n\n The patient was then placed on a gurney and the indwelling right pheresis\n catheter was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.\n\n The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complication.",

Coronal and sagittal\n reformations were evaluated.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of\n lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise\n clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the\n interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying\n anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the\n descending aorta is approximately 20.\n\n The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying\n cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast\n examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema\n likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring\n approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,\n and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No\n pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric\n and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration\n of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A\n small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.\n\n CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild\n colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall\n thickening involving the transverse and ascending colon is present.\n\n A mild-to-moderate amount of free fluid noted within the abdomen and pelvis is\n in characteristic distribution for ascites.  The fluid measures predominantly\n simple and less than the Hounsfield unit measurement of blood within the\n aorta.  Prostate is unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are\n present within the pelvis.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are present.  There is\n multilevel degenerative changes noted within the lumbar spine with mild grade\n 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4.  A slightly prominent Schmorl's node and/or\n hemangioma is also noted at the inferior aspect of the L3 vertebral body.",

[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 933**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 22835**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1092**], attending\n interventional radiologist.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1092**] was present and supervising the\n procedure.\n\n ANESTEHSIA: Local lidocaine\n\n PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to\n the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the\n angiography suite and laid in supine position.  The right neck was prepped and\n draped in standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were\n performed.  The patient's right neck was examined with ultrasound,\n demonstrating a patent and compressible right internal jugular vein.  This\n vein was cannulated with a micropuncture needle just above the clavicles. Pre-\n and post-cannulation images were obtained and printed.  A guidewire was\n advanced into the SVC through the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a\n micropuncture sheath.  The inner dilator and wire were removed and exchanged\n for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire, which was extended down into the upper right atrium.  The\n sheath was exchanged for a 14 French dilator. Following dilation, the 15 cm\n triple lumen dialysis/pheresis catheter including VIP port was advanced over\n the wire with tip terminating in the high right atrium. The wire was removed,\n the catheter flushed.  A post- procedure fluoroscopic image of the tip\n confirms the tip location in the high right atrium.  The catheter was secured\n to the skin with 0-0 silk suture and dressed appropriately.  There were no\n immediate complications.",

Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.\n\n FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft\n tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid\n muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right\n inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There\n is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the\n level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external\n jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the\n sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal\n jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.\n The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends\n inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and\n abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,\n all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal\n enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from\n the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted\n within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in\n appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of\n midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the\n left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.\n\n There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the\n airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,\n consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue\n attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion\n cannot be excluded.\n\n The osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative changes noted\n throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6.\n Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral\n bodies. seen on prior PET/CT without evidence of abnormal FDG uptake.

CTA of [**2184-12-30**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper\n abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT\n images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation\n after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial\n phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are\n provided.\n\n CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid\n rate of bolus injection required for this examination.\n\n CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior\n mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most\n recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured\n 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.\n An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple\n examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal\n descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent\n with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity\n in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no\n evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.\n The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery\n directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear\n unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries\n appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.\n\n Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density\n of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without\n evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are\n again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along\n with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or\n masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall\n is unchanged from multiple studies.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,\n and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.\n Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are\n identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter\n are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is\n consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the\n infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and\n are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at\n the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal\n arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of\n the left renal artery.\n\n Bone windows show degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, bilateral\n L5 pars defects and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  A compression\n deformity of the L2 vertebra is unchanged",

Under 1% Lidocaine local\n anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19-gauge\n needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta through\n the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 7 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4740**] catheter,\n which was advanced over the wire into the ascending aorta with the tip just\n above the aortic valve.  An aortogram was performed in RPO and LPO projections\n respectively with injection of nonionic contrast.  The aortogram demonstrated\n a normal appearing ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta, all\n major branches from the arch, as well as bilateral internal mammary arteries.\n The left common carotid artery has a common origin with brachiocephalic\n artery. There is no evidence of contrast extravasation, irregularity or\n aneurysm. The tip of the left chest tube is abutting the aortic arch. This\n finding was relayed to the ICU resident.  At the end of the procedure, the\n catheter was removed over the wire and hemostasis was achieved with manual\n compression.\n\n The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.",

For detailed description of\n the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate\n report of concurrent head CT.  There are ET and NG tubes in situ \"tamponading\"\n the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation.  However, no\n gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified.  The cervical alignment\n is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal\n retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet\n joint degenerative disease.  The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment\n is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base,\n itself.  No acute cervical spine fracture is identified.  There are multilevel\n degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial\n articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively\n [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral\n spinal canal.  There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and\n more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other\n significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.\n\n There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical\n airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.  Noted are relatively\n symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either\n atelectasis or contusion; these are better characterized on the concurrent CT\n torso.\n\n COMMENT:  Findings posted to the ED dashboard.",

PICC line placement.\n\n POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite\n and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest\n demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt\n was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its\n thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the\n Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was\n placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down\n beyond the pylorus, with the tip terminating just prior to the ligament of\n Treitz.  The wire was removed and contrast injected, confirming this location.\n A final fluoroscopic view of the abdomen was obtained.  There were no\n immediate complications.\n\n PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in\n standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed\n per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a\n guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then\n placed through the peel-away sheath with its terminating in the cavoatrial\n junction.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film\n of the chest.\n\n The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was\n secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.\n The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate\n complications.",

VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of\n intramuscular glucagon was also administered.\n\n Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and\n evaluated on the workstation.\n\n FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and\n end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small\n bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the\n anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.

Given the mesenteric distortion,\n the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.\n\n The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal\n in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid\n collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are\n not pathologically enlarged.\n\n The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal\n dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The\n major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in\n appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.\n\n Multiplanar reformations provided multiple imaging perspectives for the\n dynamic series.",

Cannot excluded infection at the lung bases, particular at the\n  right base.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  History of Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome with shortness of breath,\n desaturation, and tachycardia.  Evaluate for PE.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest without\n administration of intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, axial images were\n acquired through the chest during administration of 100 mL of intravenous\n Optiray.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.\n\n COMPARISON:  None.\n\n FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental\n levels bilaterally.  There is extensive atelectasis involving the right middle\n lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete\n collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging\n along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent\n hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right\n lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or\n pneumothorax.\n\n There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or\n axillae.  The heart and imaged portions of the great vessels are unremarkable.\n The ET tube ends at the level of the carina.  The NG tube passes below the\n level of the diaphragm and out of the imaged area inferiorly.\n\n This study was not optimized for evaluation of the abdominal contents.  The\n visualized portions of the abdomen are unremarkable, however.\n\n BONE WINDOW:  The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable.",

She had no\n anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.\n\n IMAGING METHOD:\n\n Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was\n injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.\n\n Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately\n three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.\n Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer\n injection.\n\n Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.\n\n This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n\n The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast\n attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.\n\n Left ventricular cavity size is normal.\n\n Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon\n counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation\n correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.\n\n Gated images reveal normal wall motion.\n\n The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74%",

Please evaluate for abscess,\n mediastinitis or abdominal process.\n\n COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet\n to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images\n were obtained.\n\n IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.\n\n CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the\n right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy\n tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within\n the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid\n collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within\n the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian\n artery.\n\n The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There\n is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left\n lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion\n and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small\n right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an\n increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion\n in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute\n infectious process is suspected.\n\n There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable\n pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,\n unchanged in position.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all\n unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval\n development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left\n adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic\n hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a\n simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.

The colon is filled with stool without evidence of\n obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid\n or free air is detected within the pelvis.\n\n OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is mild increased overlap of the osseous fragments\n of the sternotomy (2:28) suggesting possible movement at the sternotomy site.\n No focal fluid collections are detected within the tissues surrounding the\n sternotomy site.  There is multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar\n spine with anterior vertebral body osteophyte formation and decreased\n intervertebral bodies disc space at the L5-S1 level.",

Sagittal and coronal reformations were performed and\n reviewed.\n\n TOTAL DLP:  1470.3 mGy-cm.\n\n CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A 10 x 5-mm hypodense left thyroid lobe\n nodule (2:1) is stable since the prior study.  Mild bilateral upper lobe\n predominant centrilobular emphysema is seen. Few of the previously seen\n ground-glass nodules have resolved; however, few small sub-5-mm nodules\n scattered throughout both lungs persist and either remain unchanged or\n slightly smaller since the prior study. The nodules are seen in the right\n upper lobe (2:15, 18, 22), and right middle lobe, 2:22, left upper lobe (2:15,\n 24, 23). No new worrisome pulmonary nodule or consolidation.  There has been\n interval resolution of previously seen bilateral small pleural effusions.  The\n heart is normal in size.  Moderate-to-severe coronary arterial calcification\n is present.  The thoracic aorta has moderate atherosclerotic disease, without\n aneurysmal dilation.  The pulmonary arteries are unremarkable. There is no\n pleural or pericardial effusion.  Small scattered mediastinal lymph nodes in\n the pretracheal regions do not meet CT criteria for significant adenopathy.\n There is diffuse mild esophageal wall thickening throughout the entire\n thoracic portion, stable since the prior study, unclear etiology.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A 8-mm focus of arterial enhancement in\n the segment VII of the liver (2:54) persists, stable since the prior study,\n may represent a flash-filling hemangioma or FNH.  No new concerning liver\n lesions.  Few small gallstones are seen.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic\n biliary dilatation.  The adrenal glands, spleen, and  pancreas are normal.\n The abdominal aorta has moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic disease, with\n extensive calcified plaque seen in the infrarenal aorte (2:68) and both common\n iliac arteries. The stomach and small bowel loops are normal in appearance.\n The patient is status post right hemicolectomy with ileocolonic anastomosis\n which appears unremarkable.  The adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreas are\n normal. Scattered small retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet\n CT criteria for significant adenopathy.  There is no ascites.\n\n CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is almost\n empty.  The uterus is not visualized in the study.  The rectum and sigmoid\n colon are normal.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid is seen.\n\n BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection or malignancy\n are detected.  Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine at\n L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.",

The patient was moving and it was difficult to catheterize\n the right internal and right vertebral arteries at the time. Hence the patient\n was brought back and the present angiogram was performed under general\n anesthesia.\n\n TECHNIQUE:\n Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after\n explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained\n included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with\n possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.\n\n The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and\n placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and\n draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery\n was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using\n 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.\n Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken\n out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a\n saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a\n continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced\n and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of\n heparin in 1000 cc of saline).\n\n The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were\n performed from these locations: right common carotid artery, right internal\n carotid artery, right vertebral artery.\n\n Please note that the previous dicatation has been lost in the process of\n transcription. This is a redictation.\n\n RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:\n No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.\n\n RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:\n There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right internal carotid\n artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is an irregular\n aneurysm noted arising from the posterior communicating artery and measures\n approximately 10 x 6 x 4 mm in size. This appears to be the source of the\n hemorrhage.\n\n RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:\n There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right vertebral artery,\n basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery on both sides. No definite\n aneurysm noted.",

Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided\n infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.\n\n COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]\n as showing \"diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a\n new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is\n identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic\n thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,\n clinical correlation is recommended.\"\n\n Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat\n greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior\n hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This\n difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the\n present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.\n\n However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both\n within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This\n change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior\n MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,\n minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these\n regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.\n\n The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively\n stable in extent.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar\n reconstructions.\n\n FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.\n\n MR VENOGRAPHY\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar\n reconstructions.\n\n FINDINGS:  The appearance of the partially obstructed superior sagittal sinus\n and left transverse sinus are essentially unaltered compared to the prior\n study of [**2114-5-7**].",

The\n principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as\n does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive\n fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture\n fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the\n basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof\n fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a \"blowout\" type.  At this\n time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or\n pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of\n the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas\n collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication\n between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a\n crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right\n orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of\n this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the\n level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There\n is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided\n periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side\n adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,\n and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left\n side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is\n bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid\n sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,\n likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally\n opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial\n opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a\n probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present\n study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for\n right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours\n between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural\n hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side.",

A request\n was made for conversion of a right internal jugular temporary pheresis\n catheter to a tunneled HD catheter.\n\n CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1090**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 713**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 714**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 714**] is the attending\n radiologist who supervised the procedure.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A consent was obtained from patient's daughter after\n explaining the procedure and complications.  Patient was brought to the\n angiography suite, intubated, and sedated.  Patient was placed supine on the\n angiography table and right side of neck as well as existing catheter prepped\n and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was\n performed.  An initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate position of\n the existing line.  After appropriate measurements were made, a subcutaneous\n tunnel was created from right anterior chest wall to the skin entry site of\n the existing catheter.  A 14 French AngioDynamics catheter measuring 19 cm\n tip-to-cuff is pulled through the tunnel, exiting at site of the pre-existing\n catheter.  Both ports of the original catheter were aspirated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire\n was advanced through one of the ports into the IVC.  The existing line was\n then removed over the [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and a peel-away sheath advanced over the wire\n under fluoroscopic guidance.  The [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and inner dilator were then\n removed.  The double-lumen HD catheter was then advanced through the peel-away\n sheath and the sheath removed.  Post-procedural chest x-ray demonstrated\n appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with tip positioned in the\n right atrium.  Both ports aspirated and flushed easily.  The skin incision\n over the venopuncture site closed with 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter anchored to\n the skin with 0-silk sutures.  Sterile dressings were applied.\n\n The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate complications.",

CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic\n function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.\n\n\n Findings:\n Structure and Function\n The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence\n of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters\n of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main\n pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly\n increased.\n The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The\n end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left\n ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic\n function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.\n The left ventricular mass was normal.\n\n Coronary Imaging\n \tCT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right\n coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was\n increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left\n main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not\n aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius\n without evidence of disease.

IV contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were\n performed.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n CT CHEST:  A 1-cm right thyroid gland nodule is identified (2, 7).  An\n irregularly shaped filling defect is seen within the right internal jugular\n vein (2, 3) and may represent a clot.  The patient is status post\n tracheostomy.  Air within the mediastinum is likely related to patient's\n recent sternotomy.  Sternal wires remain intact.  A left subclavian line is\n identified and terminates within the upper SVC.  Adjacent to the sternum on\n the left side, a 1.6 cm x 1.1-cm hyperdense lesion is identified (2, 23) and\n likely represents a parasternal hematoma.  Extensive aortic and coronary\n artery calcifications are identified. Patient is status post mitral valve\n replacement. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are identified, none of which\n meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement. There is no hilar or axillary\n lymphadenopathy identified.  There is a large left pleural effusion with\n associated left lower lobe collapse.  A smaller right pleural effusion with\n small right-sided pneumothorax is identified.  A right- sided chest tube is in\n place.  There is no pericardial effusion identified.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  A G-tube is in position.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen\n and pancreas are unremarkable.  Focal thickening of the left adrenal gland is\n noted.  A 1-cm hypodense lesion is seen in the right kidney (2, 57) likely\n represents a cyst.  Loops of small bowel are normal in caliber and without\n focal wall thickening.  There is no free fluid or free air.\n\n CT OF THE PELVIS:  Bilateral inguinal hernias are identified.  The right\n inguinal hernia contains a loop of large bowel.  There is no evidence of acute\n obstruction.  A Foley catheter is in place.  There is evidence of sigmoid\n diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.

Images were acquired in end inspiration and expiration prone and\n supine position.  5, 1.25-mm collimation images and coronal reformations were\n reviewed.\n\n FINDINGS:  The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels.  Multifocal\n areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes are greater in the right\n side.  The size of the pulmonary arteries that goes towards the area of\n ground-glass opacities have the same caliber as the ones going to the\n non-affected lung.  Subpleural interstitial abnormality in the left upper lobe\n has the appearance of post-radiation changes.\n\n A tiny calcified granuloma is in the right upper lobe (series 104A, 71).  A\n 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (5, 25) is not calcified.  Tiny calcified\n granuloma is in the left lower lobe (5, 30).  There is no pleural or\n pericardial effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  Moderate calcifications are in\n the left circumflex, LAD, main left coronary, and right main coronary artery.\n Mild calcification is in the aortic annulus.  There is no mediastinal, hilar\n or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The main pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged.\n The right main pulmonary artery measures 30.5 mm.\n\n Healing fracture is in the lateral aspect of sixth left rib.  Irregularity in\n the distal aspect of the right scapula could represent an old healed fracture\n or a prominent nutrient foramen.  There are no bone findings of malignancy.\n\n In the upper abdomen there is mild splenomegaly, the liver has nodular\n contours and is mildly shrunken.  The aorta is moderately calcified.\n Calcification is seen in the ostium of the right renal artery.",

Axial images were reviewed in\n conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph\n nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is\n normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion\n is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of\n the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more\n conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall\n unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is\n not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but\n can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting\n hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound\n of the liver as a first step might be considered.\n\n Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared\n to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most\n recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the\n spleen are persistent.\n\n There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate\n changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.\n\n Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.

There is a severe acute\n soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue\n swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous\n emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-\n coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal\n bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail\n below.

The relatively thick sections suggest some\n degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,\n related to the longitudinal fracture.

The patient\n was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.\n The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile\n fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture\n needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hard copies of the ultrasound were\n stored.  A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using\n flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the\n needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The\n wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035\n [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC.  The 4.5\n French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was\n placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ.  The\n dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary\n hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the\n left IJ with the tip eventually terminated in the right atrium.  All three\n ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily.  The ports were\n capped.  The catheter was sutured to the skin and a sterile dressing was\n applied.\n\n The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate\n complications.",

A preprocedure timeout was\n performed documenting the nature of procedure and the patient identity.  The\n patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the indwelling left\n neck/left dialysis catheter was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.\n Initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line.\n First, attention was made towards creation of a tract.

Mild calcification is noted within the\n coronary tree.  No intramural hematoma is present.  Contrast-enhanced images\n display no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the\n subsegmental level.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.  There\n is dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes\n are present.  Lung parenchyma displays biapical pleural scarring and regions\n of linear scarring also noted within the medial left upper lobe with a more\n nodular region of scarring measuring approximately 6 mm within the left upper\n lobe (3:20).  Additionally, within the right lower lobe, there is a 9 x 10-mm\n nodule just adjacent to the diaphragm and a smaller nodule along right\n fissure. No focal opacities are noted within the lungs consistent with an\n underlying pneumonia. The left atrium is enlarged and there is suggestion of\n underlying LVH as well as elevated right- sided heart pressures.

Please replace by\n a gastrojejunostomy tube for aspiration prophyllaxis.\n\n RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 737**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (LF) 325**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4496**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**]\n [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the\n procedure.\n\n CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%, in stomach and [**Last Name (un) **]. IV\n conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously\n under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.\n\n PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's\n next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French\n pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035\n Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire\n such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-\n side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged\n for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left\n anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-\n pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were\n unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II\n catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in\n conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the\n jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced\n with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath\n were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the\n Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]\n gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath\n following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.\n The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,\n and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then\n performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate\n the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the\n duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the\n ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the\n stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's\n skin using 0 Prolene suture material. A Flexi-Track dressing was applied, and\n sterile gauze applied over the entry site.\n\n COMPLICATIONS:  None.",

Multiplanar reconstructions were obtained.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n There are bilateral moderate to large pleural effusions.\n\n The inferior vena cava is interrupted superior to the renal veins.  There is\n an azygous continuation of the inferior vena cava from this level and a\n dilated azygous vein drains into the superior vena cava.  There is\n reconstitution of a short segment of the inferior vena cava from the hepatic\n veins, which drains into the right atrium.  The hemiazygous vein, on the left\n side of the aorta, is prominent and drains into the azygous vein in the\n suprarenal portion.\n\n Multiplanar reconstructions on the workstation were helpful in delineating the\n above findings.\n\n KEYWORD:  VEINS",

The patient has right-sided weakness.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and STIR sagittal and gradient echo axial images of the\n cervical spine were acquired.  The axial images are limited due to motion.\n\n FINDINGS:  As suggested by history, there is a linear signal abnormality\n through the dens indicating fracture.  The fracture corresponds to a Type II\n fracture.  There is no malalignment seen at the fracture site.  The atlanto-\n odontoid distance is well maintained.  The spinal canal dimensions at C1 and\n C2 level are also maintained.\n\n Degenerative changes are seen at C3-4 and C4-5 levels.\n\n At C5-5 and C6-7 levels there is moderate spinal stenosis with mild extrinsic\n compression of the spinal cord.  The spinal stenosis is secondary to disc\n bulging and ligamentous thickening.\n\n At C7-T1 and inferiorly to T3-4 degenerative changes are identified without\n spinal stenosis.\n\n The visualized bones demonstrate an area of increased signal indicative of an\n old infarct.  The MRA/MRI examination of the head had demonstrated acute\n pontine infarct to the left of midline.",

There are no pathologically\n enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm\n mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to\n the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small\n pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an\n immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways\n are patent to the subsegmental levels.\n\n LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement\n in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with\n only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right\n lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this\n exam.  However, there are multiple new nodules with surrounding halos since\n the prior study.  For example, 5-mm right lower lobe nodule (4:174), 3-mm left\n lower lobe nodule (4:144), 2 mm left lower lobe nodule (4:134), 4 mm lingular\n nodule (4:116) are new. In immunocompromise host, the new nodules with\n surrounding halos are concerning for fungal infection.  However, if patient is\n not immunocompromised, differential includes viral infection, new bacterial\n infection, COP or less likely vasculitis.  There is no definite focal\n consolidation or pleural effusion.\n\n This study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic structures\n but shows multiple calcifications in the spleen, unchanged from prior exam.\n\n OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Since the recent prior study from [**2170-7-17**] prior\n study, there is new slight wedging of the superior endplate of L2.  Since the\n CT torso from [**2170-6-28**], there is also new deformity of the superior\n endplate of T11.  There are no other concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.",

Sequences include coronal T1\n and STIR-weighted images of the pelvis.  Axial oblique, sagittal, and coronal\n fat-saturated images of the left hip were also obtained.\n\n FINDINGS:  The bone marrow signal is essentially unremarkable.

The large left\n pelvic soft tissue mass encasing loops of small bowel is again identified.\n There are enlarged nodes coursing along the iliac vessels and within the left\n inguinal region measuring up to 13 mm in short axis dimension.\n\n There is increased STIR signal within the muscles of the left hemipelvis\n including the iliacus, psoas, obturator, adductor and gluteus muscles.  Focal\n increased STIR signal measuring approximately 16 mm (series 3:15) tracks along\n the left iliacus muscle.

Subsequent delayed contrast enhanced images of\n the brain were obtained.\n\n CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST:  The patient's known bilateral mixed density\n subdural collections are again noted.  These appear unchanged in size and\n extent in the interval.  There is persistent flattening of the adjacent\n cerebral gyri as well as narrowing of the lateral ventricles.  The basal\n cisterns are not effaced.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.\n The previously described 15 x 8 mm hyperdense focus along the left anterior\n clinoid and the suprasellar space appears unchannged.  There are probable\n punctate calcifications within it.  Differential considerations include\n aneurysm or dense mass.\n\n CTA OF INTRACRANIAL CIRCULATION: The above described hyperdense focus adjacent\n to the left anterior clinoid and suprasellar space does not demonstrate any\n evidence of enhancement during the arterial bolus.  Additionally, there is\n rightward displacement of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal\n carotid artery as well as posterior displacement of the M1 segment of the left\n MCA, indicating an element of mass effect.  However, both of these vessels\n appear to be intact.   There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.

[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 737**] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**]. Drs.\n [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.\n\n CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:\n 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given\n intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for\n conscious sedation.\n\n PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:\n The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was\n insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.\n Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted\n under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The\n lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through\n the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through\n the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The\n tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under\n fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during\n the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract\n was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube\n was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected\n through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A\n significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a\n large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the\n guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing\n balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and\n normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The\n tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected\n directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal\n location.\n\n The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed\n through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A\n 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate\n puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed\n through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7\n French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric\n antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the\n guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following\n several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first\n portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The\n multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was\n exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and\n 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then\n advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator\n was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed\n through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter\n through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz\n retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the\n gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At\n this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during\n advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-\n fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas\n insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the\n stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,\n such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was\n secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak\n dressing.\n\n COMPLICATIONS:\n Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the\n procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a\n concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day.",

The\n pump is seen inflated within the expected course of the aorta.  The Swan-Ganz\n catheter with the femoralapproach is unchanged in location with tip in the\n left pulmonary artery.  A dual-chamber pacemaker is seen on the right upper\n chest with leads in the expected location of the right ventricle and right\n atrium.\n\n The remaining chest radiograph is unchanged in appearance with a persistent\n opacification of the left base, compatible an underlying atelectasis and\n moderate pleural effusion. The right base remained relatively well aerated\n with only minor basilar atelectasis.  The remaining lung fields demonstrate no\n new opacity.  There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal contour is\n obliterated on the left, but the right contour is grossly intact.  Pulmonary\n vasculature is unremarkable without evidence of pulmonary edema.  In the\n visualized abdomen, there is retained oral contrast in the bowels.",

Assess for new dural\n sinus or venous occlusion.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.\n\n COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported\n by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing \"new occlusion of the right posterior\n cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left\n transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-\n complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the\n right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their\n counterparts on the left are probably patent.\"\n\n FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very\n similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both\n cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin\n residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There\n are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the\n question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this\n study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2\n segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the\n prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow\n patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size\n or configuration, either.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar\n reconstructions.\n\n FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the\n extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in\n the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible\n recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of\n [**Doctor Last Name 4323**], and likely the ipsilateral internal cerebral vein, is again\n redemonstrated.",

There is a pacemaker overlying\n the left hemithorax with pacer leads in stable position.  The heart size and\n mediastinal contours are stable.  There is evidence of diffuse pulmonary\n parenchymal interstitial opacity.  There is evidence of focal parenchymal\n opacity within the right upper lung zone which appears to have worsened when\n compared to [**2118-4-4**].  Within the thoracic spine, there is evidence of\n compression deformities within the mid-thoracic vertebral bodies which appear\n to have progressed when compared to [**2118-4-4**].",

A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient\n identifiers.\n\n Using standard aseptic technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under\n ultrasound guidance, multiple core biopsies were obtained of the hypoechoic\n mass in the retroareolar left breast using a 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded\n biopsy device.  A percutaneous clip was subsequently placed at the site of\n biopsy under ultrasound guidance.  The needle was removed and hemostasis was\n achieved.\n\n Post-procedure mammogram demonstrates accurate deployment of the percutaneous\n clip in the retroareolar left mass.\n\n The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.  The\n patient was discharged home with standard post-biopsy instruction.",

Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were\n generated and reviewed.\n\n FINDINGS:  This study is limited by the absence of intravenous contrast.\n Allowing for this limitation, there are multiple prominent cervical lymph\n nodes at all levels and stations.  The majority of these lymph nodes measure\n up to 1 cm in short axis and meet CT size criteria for lymphadenopathy.  Even\n though a number of these lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT\n size criteria, the multiplicity and wide extent make them compatible with\n lymphadenopathy.\n\n The visualized upper mediastinum demonstrates numerous, enlarged lymph node\n conglomerates in the bilateral axillary regions measuring up to 20 x 15 mm in\n the right axilla and 27 x 23 mm in the left axilla.  Multiple superior\n mediastinal lymph nodes appear prominent.  The visualized lung apices are\n clear.  The central tracheobronchial tree is patent.\n\n The visualized posterior fossa is unremarkable.  The visualized paranasal\n sinuses and bilateral mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.\n\n OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no acute cervical fracture or malalignment.  No\n suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified in the bone.",
