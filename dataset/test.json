Evaluate thorax and lungs.\n\n FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest view demonstrates the presence of an\n electronic capsule in left anterior chest wall position.  Thin wire electrodes\n are noted in the anterior chest wall and lead to electrode termination points\n in the left-sided paravertebral space at level Th1 and Th2.  Apparently, this\n represents the vagal nerve stimulator.  The skeletal structures of the thorax\n are unremarkable.  The heart size is within normal limits.  Thoracic aorta and\n mediastinal structures are unremarkable.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal,\n and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  No acute parenchymal\n infiltrates can be identified.  Available for comparison is a similar previous\n chest examination dated [**2100-12-15**].  At that time, present right\n internal jugular vein central venous line has been removed.  As before,\n evidence of healed rib fractures on the left side of [**Doctor Last Name **] 5 and 6 appear\n unchanged.  A surgical clip is noted in the vicinity of the rib fracture\n raising the suspicion that this injury was related to a previous surgical\n intervention.\n\n On the lateral view, calcifications within the aortic valve area are\n identified.  They appear to have three components and thus rather typical for\n aortic valve stenosis involving all the three cusps.  Comparison with the next\n previous chest examination of [**2100-12-15**], confirms the presence of these\n calcifications.  The heart is not significantly enlarged and there is no\n evidence of CHF.  No evidence of significant poststenotic dilatation of the\n ascending aorta on the frontal view.",

Optiray was selected secondary for\n need for fast bolus.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is good opacification of the thoracic\n and abdominal aorta. No intimal flaps are seen to suggest an aortic\n dissection. Additionally there is no evidence of mediastinal hematoma. There\n are very small bilateral low density pleural effusions with associated\n atelectasis. Although this was not performed as a pulmonary CTA there are no\n large, central thrombi within the pulmonary arterial vessels. In the region of\n the subsegmental branch in the right lower lobe there is a suggestion of\n filling defect that is of uncertain significance. No additional filling\n defects are seen within the basilar and pulmonary arteries. There is no\n evidence of a pericardial effusion and additionally there is no evidence of a\n thoracic or abdominal aorta. There is atelectasis primarily involving the\n bases as well as scarring of the right middle lobe.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,\n and kidneys are unremarkable. Once again seen is a right adrenal adenoma.\n There is extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta and its tributaries.\n\n There is colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.\n\n BONE WINDOWS: There is subchondral cysts of the right scapula. There are\n multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.\n\n Incidental note is made of a splenule adjacent to the spleen.",

Evaluate for fluid collection.\n\n COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound of [**2153-5-27**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Abdominal ultrasound.\n\n FINDINGS:  The study is again technically limited due to surgical incisions,\n and the presence of bandage material.  The liver is diffusely coarse and\n nodular consistent with cirrhosis.  A focal tiny amount of fluid is seen in\n the subhepatic space adjacent to the falciform ligament and gallbladder fossa.\n Some additional hypoechogenicity within this region most likely reflects\n post-surgical changes in the resection bed.  There is no intra- or\n extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation with the common hepatic duct measuring 3\n mm.  The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.  Spleen remains enlarged\n measuring 14.9 cm.  A tubular structure within the falciform ligament is also\n again seen, which does not demonstrate internal flow, but may represent a\n portion of the patient's recanalized paraumbilical vein with markedly slow\n flow.\n\n Targeted son[**Name (NI) 211**] imaging of the region adjacent to the obliquely oriented\n surgical incision, shows an oblong fluid collection which measures 2.4 x 3.7\n cm in the transverse plane and spans from mid abdomen to low pelvis, measuring\n at least 20 cm in the SI dimension.  This is lobulated and heterogeneously\n hypoechoic and probably located within or just deep to the abdominal wall\n musculature, and is felt most likely to represent a hematoma.  A surgical\n drain enters the right lower quadrant, but the tip of the drain could not be\n detected due to the presence of overlying bandage material, so its\n relationship to this collection is not ascertained.",

Balloon of the endotracheal tube is slightly expanded beyond\n the diameters of the trachea.  Mild compression is recommended.  Right\n internal jugular central venous catheter is seen in stable position emanating\n in the middle superior vena cava.  The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of\n normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Pulmonary vasculature\n bilaterally is normal.  The right costophrenic angle is not visualized;\n however, the remaining lungs are clear without evidence of infiltrates,\n effusions, or consolidations.  The surrounding soft tissue and osseous\n structures reveal a clinical device overlying the left hemithorax.",
