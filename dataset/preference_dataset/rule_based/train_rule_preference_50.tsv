 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.
 There is no lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted again
 consistent with history of peritoneal lavage.

 HISTORY:  70 year old diabetic man with CHF and increasing abdominal
 distention and falling hematocrit unresponsive to transfusions.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 without IV contrast.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases demonstrate moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The attenuation values
 of these suggest simple fluid.

 Images through the heart demonstrate coronary artery calcifications.

 There are calcifications seen in the aorta, iliac, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 635**], and celiac,
 splenic, and renal arteries.  Evaluation of intraabdominal organs is limited
 secondary to lack of IV and oral contrast.  Given these limitations, the
 kidneys appear slightly atrophic.  The spleen, gallbladder, liver are
 unremarkable.  The loops of bowel are not distended.  There is no free air or
 free fluid in the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is  calcification of the vas
 deferens.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.  There is no free air or

 present and supervising throughout.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was provided with injection of 1% lidocaine to
 the posterior soft tissues overlying the spinal access point.  No IV sedation
 or pain medication was administered, per the request of the primary team.
 However, due to extreme patient discomfort, a total of 50 mcg fentanyl and 1
 mg Versed was administered following the procedure.

 The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed on the
 fluoroscopic table in prone position.  Access to the lumbar subarachnoid space
 was obtained at the level of L3-4.  20 and 18 gauge needles were used for
 access under local anesthesia, using 1% lidocaine and with aseptic
 precautions.  Average measured CSF pressure was 15.  Due to severe patient
 discomfort and low flow of CSF, only two 5 cc tubes were filled, with trace
 fluid in tube 3. <question> Was the spinal needle successful in taping some spinal fluid?"	"two 5 cc tubes were filled, with trace

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with Type II dens fracture on CT of the spine.
 For further evaluation.  The patient has right-sided weakness.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and STIR sagittal and gradient echo axial images of the
 cervical spine were acquired.  The axial images are limited due to motion.

 FINDINGS:  As suggested by history, there is a linear signal abnormality
 through the dens indicating fracture.  The fracture corresponds to a Type II
 fracture.  There is no malalignment seen at the fracture site.  The atlanto-
 odontoid distance is well maintained.  The spinal canal dimensions at C1 and

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid

 CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A 10 x 5-mm hypodense left thyroid lobe
 nodule (2:1) is stable since the prior study.  Mild bilateral upper lobe
 predominant centrilobular emphysema is seen. Few of the previously seen
 ground-glass nodules have resolved; however, few small sub-5-mm nodules
 scattered throughout both lungs persist and either remain unchanged or
 slightly smaller since the prior study. The nodules are seen in the right
 upper lobe (2:15, 18, 22), and right middle lobe, 2:22, left upper lobe (2:15,

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.

 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the

 cerebral gyri as well as narrowing of the lateral ventricles.  The basal
 cisterns are not effaced.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
 The previously described 15 x 8 mm hyperdense focus along the left anterior
 clinoid and the suprasellar space appears unchannged.  There are probable
 punctate calcifications within it.  Differential considerations include
 aneurysm or dense mass.

 CTA OF INTRACRANIAL CIRCULATION: The above described hyperdense focus adjacent
 to the left anterior clinoid and suprasellar space does not demonstrate any
 evidence of enhancement during the arterial bolus.  Additionally, there is
 rightward displacement of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal
 carotid artery as well as posterior displacement of the M1 segment of the left
 MCA, indicating an element of mass effect.  However, both of these vessels
 appear to be intact.   There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.  The
 visualized intracranial arterial circulation is otherwise normal.

 DELAYED CONTRAST ENHANCED CT IMAGES OF THE BRAIN: The previously described
 hyperdensity corresponds to a lobular mass abutting the left anterior clinoid
 and adjacent suprasellar space.  This lesion demonstrates modest contrast
 enhancement and contains punctate calcifications within it.  The most likely
 differential consideration in this location given these characteristics is a
 meningioma. <question> Do we see anuerysm in the suprasellar cistern?"	no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation	no_answer

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 History of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had a previous angiogram on
 the previous day. The patient was moving and it was difficult to catheterize
 the right internal and right vertebral arteries at the time. Hence the patient
 was brought back and the present angiogram was performed under general
 anesthesia.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: right common carotid artery, right internal
 carotid artery, right vertebral artery.

 Please note that the previous dicatation has been lost in the process of
 transcription. This is a redictation.

 RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right internal carotid
 artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is an irregular
 aneurysm noted arising from the posterior communicating artery and measures
 approximately 10 x 6 x 4 mm in size. This appears to be the source of the
 hemorrhage.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Again seen are metallic sutures fixating multiple
 comminuted fractures of the frontal calvarium.  There is discontinuity of the
 bone, with no osseous fusion of these fractures.  The previously seen
 pneumocephalus has resolved.  Bilateral subdural fluid collections have
 decreased slightly in size measuring 5 mm in greatest diameter.  There is a
 small osseous fragment within the subdural space.  The frontal sinuses are
 distorted and there is soft tissue and fat within the left frontal sinus.  The
 right frontal sinus is moderately aerated.  There is persistent mucosal
 thickening in the ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening in the
 visualized portion of the left maxillary sinus.  The visualized brain
 parenchyma is within normal limits, with no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was the PICC placed?"	"tip positioned in the

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural
 abnormalities characterized by a semi-translucent line with some locally
 increased sclerosis consistent with a transverse nondisplaced fracture,
 apparently now healed.  Again analysis of soft tissue structures does not
 disclose evidence for joint effusion.  Also on the left side the patient has
 extensive arterial wall calcifications.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Are there any skull bone fractures?"	right frontal skull fracture	"are patent.  There are moderate left and milder

 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal.

 Comparison is made to film from one day earlier.

 The patient is status post interval median sternotomy. A swan ganz catheter is
 in place with its tip in the right ventricle.  A small radiopacity at the
 level of the inferior aspect of the aortic arch is presumably the intra aortic
 balloon pump marker, which is therefore in satisfactory position.

 The right hemithorax is clear.  There is increased density at the left base
 with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and lower costophrenic angle,
 findings which may reflect effusion with associated atelectasis. Pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.

 INDICATION:  43-year-old female patient with recurrent ovarian neoplasm.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
 following the administration of oral contrast.  Intravenous contrast was not
 administered due to history of iodine allergy.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2193-1-15**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT THORAX:

 No suspicious pulmonary nodule is seen.  No other pulmonary abnormality is
 identified.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

 CT ABDOMEN:

 No focal abnormality is identified within the liver on this study performed
 without intravenous contrast.  The adrenal glands, pancreas, and spleen appear
 normal.  A small area of accessory splenic tissue is again identified adjacent
 to the pancreatic tail.  There is hydronephrosis of the left kidney and
 dilatation of the left ureter to the level of the pelvic brim, unchanged since
 the previous CT.  A right extrarenal pelvis is again identified.  No focal
 abnormality is seen in the right kidney. Several small mesenteric lymph nodes
 are again identified in the left lower abdomen (series 2, image 81), with
 largest measuring 10 mm x 8 mm diameter in comparison to 13 mm x 11 mm on
 prior scan. Although this study was performed without intravenous contrast,
 apparent narrowing of the celiac artery at its origin from the aorta (series
 2, image 57) may represent stenosis.

 CT PELVIS:

 A colostomy is again identified in the left lower abdominal wall.  The large
 left-sided pelvic mass has decreased in size from 93 mm x 81 mm on CT
 [**2193-1-15**] to 87 mm x 54 mm on current scan.  A loop of small bowel with mural
 thickening and mild luminal dilatation is encased by this mass lesion.  The
 tumor also encases the cecal tip.  There is no significant dilatation of the
 small bowel proximal to the lesion, and contrast is seen to pass into the
 right side of the colon.  A 10 mm x 7-mm left external iliac lymph node
 (series 2, image 111) is unchanged in size since prior CT and CT [**2192-12-23**].

 CT OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 A small area of sclerosis most to the acetabulum of the right iliac bone

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 SOFT TISSUE:  No evidence of subcutaneous free air in the imaged portion of
 the soft tissue.  Please note that part of the soft tissue of the right pelvis

 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Unenhanced images of
 the chest display moderate atherosclerotic disease within the aortic valve,
 aortic arch, and mitral valve.  Mild calcification is noted within the
 coronary tree.  No intramural hematoma is present.  Contrast-enhanced images
 display no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the
 subsegmental level.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.  There
 is dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
 are present.  Lung parenchyma displays biapical pleural scarring and regions
 of linear scarring also noted within the medial left upper lobe with a more
 nodular region of scarring measuring approximately 6 mm within the left upper
 lobe (3:20).  Additionally, within the right lower lobe, there is a 9 x 10-mm
 nodule just adjacent to the diaphragm and a smaller nodule along right
 fissure. No focal opacities are noted within the lungs consistent with an
 underlying pneumonia. The left atrium is enlarged and there is suggestion of
 underlying LVH as well as elevated right- sided heart pressures.  The patient
 is noted to be status post left mastectomy and axillary node dissection.

 Please note this examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.

 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 REASON FOR EXAM:  New desaturation.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

 Cardiac size is normal.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm but
 likely in the stomach.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  Left
 transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in unchanged position one in the right
 atrium and the second one could be just at the entrance of the right
 ventricle.  Moderate to large right pleural effusion has minimally increased
 in size.  Right IJ catheter tip in the cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral
 pulmonary enlargement is stable.  The lungs are hyperinflated due to
 emphysema.  Right apical opacity likely related with past tuberculosis and
 fibrotic changes is stable.  Left apical pleural thickening is also stable.
 Asymmetric opacification of the lungs that is mild, greater on the right side
 has increased on the right mid lung and suggest a new area of infectious
 process.  Otherwise mild edema is stable. <question> Do we see any inflammation in the lung parenchyma?"	"Asymmetric opacification of the lungs that is mild, greater on the right side

 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted
 within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in
 appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of
 midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the
 left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.

 There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the
 airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,
 consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior

 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in
 the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible
 recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodules and
 known history of CLL.

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared
 to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most
 recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the
 spleen are persistent.

 There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate
 changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.

 Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.  The vast majority
 of previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground glass
 opacities have resolved or decreased in size.  On the other hand, multiple new

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear

 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian

 INDICATION:
 83-year-old male with left pontine infarction with dense right hemiplegia.
 Long-term feeding required.

 Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 737**] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**]. Drs.
 [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS:
 Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the
 procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a
 concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day. <question> was the placement of G tube successful?"	Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms	"through

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Is there any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage?"	"right posterior

 TRAUMA SERIES.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  There are low inspiratory volumes and overlying trauma
 board artifact.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 accounted for by these technical factors.  There is a rounded density along
 the right heart border - this likely represents vascular structures, but
 attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No gross CHF, focal
 contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  Some opacity overlies the
 lower trachea, but is of uncertain significance on this view.  The remainder
 of the trachea is within normal limits.

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT enterography was performed. Helically acquired axial images
 were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis after administration
 of 145 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary
 to patient's allergies.  CT coronal reconstructions were also obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear.  The
 liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are tiny,
 hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, which most likely
 represent simple cysts.  Patient is status post cholecystectomy. There are
 multiple surgical clips seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.  There is a
 hiatal hernia present.  There is diastasis recti within the upper abdomen
 without a hernia sac present.  There are small pericardial and mesenteric
 lymph nodes.  No significant lymphadenopathy is present. There is no free air
 or fluid within the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  There is a small, left paramedian hernia, best

 INDICATION:  81-year-old male with mediastinal wound dehiscence and elevated
 white blood cell count, of unknown etiology.  Please evaluate for abscess,
 mediastinitis or abdominal process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is stable herniation of colon through the
 right inguinal canal and new herniation of colon at the ostium of the left
 inguinal canal.  The colon is filled with stool without evidence of
 obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid
 or free air is detected within the pelvis.

 CLINICAL INDICATION: 75 year old male with intracranial hemorrhage after a
 fall and findings on a prior noncontrast CT scan concerning for an aneurysm or
 mass.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging of the brain without IV contrast enhancement,
 followed by helical CT imaging of the major intracranial arteries during rapid
 infusion of 100 cc of Optiray.  Subsequent delayed contrast enhanced images of
 the brain were obtained.

 CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST:  The patient's known bilateral mixed density
 subdural collections are again noted.  These appear unchanged in size and
 extent in the interval.  There is persistent flattening of the adjacent
 cerebral gyri as well as narrowing of the lateral ventricles.  The basal
 cisterns are not effaced.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
 The previously described 15 x 8 mm hyperdense focus along the left anterior
 clinoid and the suprasellar space appears unchannged.  There are probable
 punctate calcifications within it.  Differential considerations include
 aneurysm or dense mass.

 CTA OF INTRACRANIAL CIRCULATION: The above described hyperdense focus adjacent
 to the left anterior clinoid and suprasellar space does not demonstrate any
 evidence of enhancement during the arterial bolus.  Additionally, there is
 rightward displacement of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal
 carotid artery as well as posterior displacement of the M1 segment of the left
 MCA, indicating an element of mass effect.  However, both of these vessels
 appear to be intact.   There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.  The
 visualized intracranial arterial circulation is otherwise normal.

 DELAYED CONTRAST ENHANCED CT IMAGES OF THE BRAIN: The previously described
 hyperdensity corresponds to a lobular mass abutting the left anterior clinoid
 and adjacent suprasellar space.  This lesion demonstrates modest contrast
 enhancement and contains punctate calcifications within it.  The most likely
 differential consideration in this location given these characteristics is a
 meningioma. <question> Do we see anuerysm in the suprasellar cistern?"	no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation	"The

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the pubic
 symphysis without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
 images are provided.

 CONTRAST:  No contrast was administered.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A mediastinal hematoma with
 largest component anterior to the main pulmonary artery is unchanged in size
 from the examination of one day prior, measuring 4.1 x 7.0 cm in greatest
 transaxial dimension.  Small hemopericardium is also unchanged.  Again seen is
 marked atheromatous calcification of the aorta and ascending aortic aneurysm
 with unchanged diameter of 5 cm.  The central airways are patent.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have increased since the examination of one day
 prior, moderate-to-large bilaterally.  The density of the effusions is
 unchanged, at approximately 20 Hounsfield units on the left and 3 Hounsfield
 units on the right.  Passive atelectasis in the adjacent parenchyma is
 increased, and emphysematous changes are again noted. A noncalcified are of
 focal pleural thickening in the right hemithorax is unchanged.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Again seen is marked
 atheromatous calcification of the aorta and an infrarenal abdominal aortic
 aneurysm measuring up to 3.2 cm.  There is no intra-abdominal hematoma.
 Bilateral renal cysts appear unchanged.  There is a tiny calcification in the
 interpolar region of the right kidney likely representing a nonobstructing
 stone.  Allowing for noncontrast technique, the liver, spleen, pancreas and
 adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Colostomy seen in the left lower quadrant
 with adjacent fluid in a parastomal hernia. There is no free intraperitoneal
 air.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder contains a Foley
 catheter and contrast consistent with the previously administered dose from
 the examination of one day prior.  A bowel containing right inguinal hernia is
 again noted, without evidence of bowel obstruction.  Multiple brachytherapy
 seeds are seen throughout the prostate gland.  The rectum and sigmoid colon,

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a fracture of the right humeral head which is

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.
 There is no lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted again
 consistent with history of peritoneal lavage.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, in another institution,
 recurrent chylothorax, repeated right pleural aspirates positive for
 triglycerides.  Left pleural effusion not aspirated.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.  Background of right mastectomy, right chest radiation and
 thyroidectomy.  Mild chronic renal impairment.  Low serum calcium, elevated
 serum phosphate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was
 performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for
 display in the axial plane at 1.25- and 5-mm collimation.  A series of
 multiplanar reformation images are also submitted for review.

 FINDINGS:  No prior CT is available for comparison.
 The patient has had a right mastectomy.  The thyroid is absent.  Mixed lytic
 and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, both anterior first ribs, medial
 clavicles, and many of the thoracic vertebrae are extensive, there is
 associated soft tissue calcification anterior to the right sternoclavicular
 joint.  The thoracic spine is scoliotic.  Exuberant calcification of the
 thoracic and abdominal aorta, the innominate, left common carotid, and left
 subclavian artery origins, coronary arteries, and the right renal artery
 ostium is markedly severe.  A left pleural effusion is moderately large.  The
 right pleural effusion shown on the chest radiograph dated [**2184-8-3**] has
 completely resolved after chest drain insertion (2, 44), its side hole is
 within the pleural cavity.  Linear scarring in the medial aspect of the right
 upper lobe (2:14), most likely represents prior radiation therapy and
 subsequent cicatricial atelectasis.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower
 lobe is moderately severe.  Ground glass attenuation of the left lung is of
 uncertain significance and could represent lymphatic obstruction, as the
 function of the moderately large left pleural effusion.  The airways are
 patent to the subsegmental level.
 The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The upper
 esophagus is mildly dilated, which places patient at an increased risk of
 aspiration.  A focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess may
 represent calcified adenopathy.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of
 the upper abdomen, only to confirm normal-appearing adrenal glands and the
 absence of upper abdominal ascites. <question> Are there any lymph node enlargements?"	no_answer	Mild chronic renal impairment.

 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,

 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74% <question> How well is the blood supply to the heart?"	"reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the
 pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast due to the patient's
 elevated GFR.  Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.

 NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT:  Aside from mild dependent atelectasis, lung bases are
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Coronary artery
 calcifications are incompletely imaged.

 The small bowel is diffusely dilated and fluid-filled, measuring up to 4.3cm,
 without a discrete transition point.  The cecum is air distended, measuring 10
 cm in diameter.  There is fat stranding and a small amount of fluid adjacent
 to the cecum (2:64 and 300B:29).  The location and orientation of the cecum is
 normal, in the right lower quadrant.  The appendix is not visualized.  The
 colon contains fluid from the transverse colon through the sigmoid.  The
 distal sigmoid and rectum contain stool.  There is a hiatal hernia.  There is
 no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and no free air in the
 abdomen.

 The lack of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal viscera

 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic

 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest without
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, axial images were
 acquired through the chest during administration of 100 mL of intravenous
 Optiray.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental
 levels bilaterally.  There is extensive atelectasis involving the right middle
 lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete
 collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging
 along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent
 hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and

 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub
 centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
 Findings are in keeping with multiple  pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms
 and could be further evaluated with MRCP.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.

 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity

 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and  reviewed the study.

 ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
 procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The
 potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and
 confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and
 placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and
 indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]
 protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a
 micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a
 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a
 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected
 and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire
 with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the

 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 HISTORY:  53-year-old man with HIV, hep C, substance abuse who presents with
 fever and mental status changes.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained with oral contrast.  No IV contrast was administered due to patient's
 allergy.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

 CT CHEST:  Coronary and aortic calcifications are identified.  The heart size
 is normal.  There is prominent axillary and mediastinal adenopathy.  There are
 bilateral nodular and consolidative opacities, most prominently involving the
 lower lobes in a dependent fashion.  Small opacities and consolidation were
 also noted in the right middle lobe.  There are no pleural or pericardial
 effusions.  A nasogastric tube is coiled within the mid esophagus.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Within the limits of this study without contrast, the liver,
 gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel
 loops are within normal limits.  There is no free air or free fluid.  No
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.  There does
 appear to be some mesenteric stranding however the evaluation is quite limited
 by the lack of abdominal fat.

 CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder.  There are
 prostatic and vascular calcifications.  The sigmoid colon and rectum are
 unremarkable.  The appendix is normal.  There is no free fluid and no pelvic
 or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT enterography was performed. Helically acquired axial images
 were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis after administration
 of 145 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary
 to patient's allergies.  CT coronal reconstructions were also obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear.  The
 liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are tiny,
 hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, which most likely
 represent simple cysts.  Patient is status post cholecystectomy. There are
 multiple surgical clips seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.  There is a
 hiatal hernia present.  There is diastasis recti within the upper abdomen
 without a hernia sac present.  There are small pericardial and mesenteric
 lymph nodes.  No significant lymphadenopathy is present. There is no free air
 or fluid within the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  There is a small, left paramedian hernia, best
 seen on Series 2, Image 57.  There is a small bowel loop extending into this

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the

 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 INDICATION: Status post MVA, car vs tree.

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a fracture of the right humeral head which is
 comminuted with impaction of the distal fracture fragment.  The fragmented
 humeral head is articulating within the glenoid fossa. A comminuted, but
 nondisplaced fracture of the right clavicle is also present.  There is
 widening of the right sternoclavicular joint. The underling subclavian vessels
 are patent, without evidence of surrounding hematoma.  No scapular fracture is
 seen. There are deformities of multiple ribs anteriorly, bilaterally,
 suggestive of traumatic injury. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the

 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for
 right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours
 between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural
 hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side. <question> Do we see any mandibular fractures?"	no_answer	"intracranial region. There is a

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are

 INDICATION:  43-year-old female patient with recurrent ovarian neoplasm.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
 following the administration of oral contrast.  Intravenous contrast was not
 administered due to history of iodine allergy.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2193-1-15**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT THORAX:

 No suspicious pulmonary nodule is seen.  No other pulmonary abnormality is
 identified.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

 CT ABDOMEN:

 No focal abnormality is identified within the liver on this study performed
 without intravenous contrast.  The adrenal glands, pancreas, and spleen appear
 normal.  A small area of accessory splenic tissue is again identified adjacent
 to the pancreatic tail.  There is hydronephrosis of the left kidney and
 dilatation of the left ureter to the level of the pelvic brim, unchanged since
 the previous CT.  A right extrarenal pelvis is again identified.  No focal
 abnormality is seen in the right kidney. Several small mesenteric lymph nodes
 are again identified in the left lower abdomen (series 2, image 81), with
 largest measuring 10 mm x 8 mm diameter in comparison to 13 mm x 11 mm on
 prior scan. Although this study was performed without intravenous contrast,
 apparent narrowing of the celiac artery at its origin from the aorta (series
 2, image 57) may represent stenosis.

 CT PELVIS:

 A colostomy is again identified in the left lower abdominal wall.  The large
 left-sided pelvic mass has decreased in size from 93 mm x 81 mm on CT
 [**2193-1-15**] to 87 mm x 54 mm on current scan.  A loop of small bowel with mural
 thickening and mild luminal dilatation is encased by this mass lesion.  The
 tumor also encases the cecal tip.  There is no significant dilatation of the
 small bowel proximal to the lesion, and contrast is seen to pass into the
 right side of the colon.  A 10 mm x 7-mm left external iliac lymph node
 (series 2, image 111) is unchanged in size since prior CT and CT [**2192-12-23**].

 CT OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:

 A small area of sclerosis most to the acetabulum of the right iliac bone
 (series 2, image 112) is unchanged since prior study.  No suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic lesions are seen in the remainder of the bony skeleton. <question> Is there any lymphadenopathy?"	"Several small mesenteric lymph nodes

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after

 Comparison made to a prior CT of the sinuses dated [**2140-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  There is persistent pneumocephalus seen along the anterior frontal
 convexities.  Given that the pneumocephalus has persisted since the prior
 study on [**10-7**], the finding is of concern for perhaps a connection of
 the intracranial structures with the sinuses.  There is a small discontinuity
 of the inner plate of the frontal sinus, which could perhaps represent a
 connection.  However, better evaluation of this could be performed with a
 facial CT scan, as it has thinner images through the bones of the facial bone.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from

 CHEST CT, [**7-17**]

 HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with lymphoma and fever.  Possible pneumonia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
 the need for intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1309**] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and
 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images compared to
 chest CT scanning since [**2170-5-17**], most recently [**2170-6-28**]:

 FINDINGS:  Bronchocentric ground-glass and bronchiolar nodulation almost
 entirely restricted to the right upper lobe has improved substantially since
 [**2170-6-28**] when the process was both more widespread in all lobes, and more
 severe in the right upper lobe.  A solid 6-mm wide right middle lobe nodule,
 3:34, is new.  Because there was no precursor lesion to this on [**6-28**] and
 because it is far more solid than any of the residual bronchocentric
 infection, this nodule is either infection due to another pathogen, such as
 Nocardia, or lymphoma.

 There is no pathologic enlargement of central lymph nodes which range up to 5
 mm in the right upper paratracheal station, 2:13, previously 7.6 mm and 7 mm
 in the left lower paratracheal station, 2:22, previously 8.9 mm.
 Atherosclerotic calcification is punctate, scattered in the left anterior
 descending coronary artery.  Small pericardial effusion has decreased since

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

 CLINICAL INDICATION: 52 year old man with cardiopath and previous pulmonary
 embolism. Now presents with back and right leg pain in S1/S2 distribution.

 COMPARISON: Outside CT abdomen dated [**2195-7-15**].

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were obtained throughout the lumbar spine after
 intrathecal injection of contrast from a myelogram. Sagittal and coronal
 reconstructions were provided. The images were reviewed using soft tissue and
 bone window algorithms.

 FINDINGS:

 The normal lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine is maintained. There is
 minimal dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine. There is grade I retrolisthesis
 of L3 over L4 and of L5 over S1 vertebra. There is grade I anterolisthesis of
 L4 over L5 vertebra.

 The vertebral bodies are normal in height. Schmorl's nodes are noted along the
 inferior endplates of L1 and L4 vertebral bodies.

 There is decreased L3-L4 to L5-S1 intervertebral discs height.

 The distribution of the contrast surrounding the conus medullaris appears
 normal and the conus terminates at the level of L1-L2 level.

 At T11-T12, there is posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac.

 At T12-L1, there is no neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.

 At L1-L2 and L2-L3, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal
 stenosis.

 At L3-L4, there is posterior disc bulge with superimposed central protrusion
 which along with posterior endplate osteophytes and facet arthropathy causes
 moderate spinal canal stenosis and crowding of nerve roots of cauda equina.
 The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes moderate bilateral neural
 foraminal stenosis.

 At L4-L5, there is posterior disc bulge which along with ligamentum flavum
 thickening and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis. The
 disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes severe right and moderate
 left neural foraminal stenosis.

 HISTORY:  53-year-old man with HIV, hep C, substance abuse who presents with
 fever and mental status changes.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained with oral contrast.  No IV contrast was administered due to patient's
 allergy.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

 CT CHEST:  Coronary and aortic calcifications are identified.  The heart size
 is normal.  There is prominent axillary and mediastinal adenopathy.  There are
 bilateral nodular and consolidative opacities, most prominently involving the
 lower lobes in a dependent fashion.  Small opacities and consolidation were
 also noted in the right middle lobe.  There are no pleural or pericardial
 effusions.  A nasogastric tube is coiled within the mid esophagus.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Within the limits of this study without contrast, the liver,

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius
 without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not
 aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to
 the right coronary artery.  The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of
 disease.  The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease.  The calcium score
 was 0.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet off the ground.
 Per trauma team, patient is neurologically intact.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 Limited views through the skull base show no gross abnormality.  Limited views
 through the lung apices show mild dependent atelectasis. <question> What does the cervical spine look like?"	"Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both

 INDICATION: Assess progression of multifocal intracranial hemorrhage in post-
 trauma patient.

 TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

 COMPARISON: [**2106-9-10**].

 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: In the interval since the prior study, a ventriculostomy
 tube has been placed via right frontal craniostomy.   The ventriculostomy tube
 passes through the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 39**] of the right lateral ventricle and passes
 through the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 565**].  The right lateral ventricle is little changed
 in configuration.  The left lateral ventricle also appears unchanged. There is
 no interval change in dependent hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles
 bilaterally.  There is no interval change in multiple foci of hemorrhage
 throughout both cerebral hemispheres and there is also no interval change in
 the subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Please seen prior report from [**2106-9-10**] for further
 details.  There is no evidence of subfalcine or uncoherniation.  The
 visualized soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.  The mastoid
 air cells are clear. Air fluid levels are noted in the visualized portions of
 the ethmoid, sphenoid

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x
 1.0 cm (2:64).

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.  Clips
 are seen in the sigmoid.  There is no free fluid.  Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes
 measure up to 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right (2:113) and 1.8 x 4.3 cm at the left
 pelvic sidewall (2:108).  There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 CMR Technical Information:
 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
 2) Function: Breath-hold cine Steady-state free precession (SSFP) images were
 acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis,
 contiguous short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the
 left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
 4) Perfusion/Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
 segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition, short-axis, four chamber and
 two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
 total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 Magnevist  solution).


 Findings:
 The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.

 Structure and Function
 There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial
 fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal
 intensity.  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small
 (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were
 identified in their customary positions.  The diameters of the ascending
 aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal.  The left
 atrial AP dimension was mildly increased.  The left atrial dimensions in the
 4-chamber view was mildly increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged.  The left
 ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated.  The
 calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%,
 with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global
 hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of
 the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricular mass was normal.
 The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated
 right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional
 and global systolic function.
 The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.

 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
 significant aortic regurgitation.  There was no significant mitral
 regurgitation.  The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow
 demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.

 Viability
 There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal
 portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral
 segments, and the apex.   The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with
 poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.
  The infarct/LV mass ratio was 0.33. <question> Does the heart muscle show any ischemia?"	no_answer	"The left
 ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated."

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST

 INDICATION:  85-year-old woman status post resection of left facial tumor,
 persistently tachycardic, desats to 80s on room air, rule out PE.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning
 is performed from the thoracic inlet through the diaphragm prior to and during
 dynamic injection of 100 cc of Optiray.

 No prior studies are available for comparison.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary,
 mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary arteries are well
 opacified.  There are no filling defects.  A small left pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  There is left
 lower lobe consolidation.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is noted. There
 are no lung nodules or masses.  An NG tube is identified.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal gallbladder, liver,
 and spleen.  A 1.2 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland measures 16 Hounsfield
 units, is thus indeterminate but most consistent with an adenoma.  A 3.5 cm
 hypodense lesion in the right kidney at mid pole measures 13 Hounsfield units
 and is consistent with a cyst.

 HISTORY:  Inferior ST elevation MI complicated by ATN and acute renal failure.
 The patient has been on CVVH then temporary hemodialysis with need for more
 permanent access.  Request for conversion of the temporary line to a tunneled
 line.

 Comparison is made to prior examination of [**2154-3-18**].

 OPERATORS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 255**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17**], and Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 65**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
 procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Successful conversion of prior temporary dialysis line to left-
 sided 15.5 French 23 cm cuff-to-tip dual-lumen dialysis catheter.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient and
 the [**Hospital 353**] healthcare proxy via telephone.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed documenting the nature of procedure and the patient identity.  The
 patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the indwelling left
 neck/left dialysis catheter was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.
 Initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line.
 First, attention was made towards creation of a tract.  Appropriate
 measurements were made and the subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with
 epinephrine buffered lidocaine.  A small incision was made and the dialysis
 catheter was tunneled through the left chest wall subcutaneous tissue. The
 indwelling catheter was then aspirated removing all heparin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66**] wire
 was advanced through the indwelling lumen into the IVC.  The previously placed
 line was then removed over a wire and a 16 French sheath/dilator device was
 advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The indwelling [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire
 and dilator device were then removed and the dual-lumen dialysis catheter was
 advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Post-procedural radiograph
 demonstrated appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with the tip in
 the right atrium.  The skin [**Doctor Last Name 695**] near the jugular access entry point was
 closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the catheter was secured with 0 silk. Sterile
 dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no

 INDICATION:  Hernia recurrence.  Multiple hernia repairs.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-4-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT enterography was performed. Helically acquired axial images
 were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis after administration
 of 145 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary
 to patient's allergies.  CT coronal reconstructions were also obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear.  The
 liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are tiny,
 hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, which most likely
 represent simple cysts.  Patient is status post cholecystectomy. There are
 multiple surgical clips seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.  There is a
 hiatal hernia present.  There is diastasis recti within the upper abdomen
 without a hernia sac present.  There are small pericardial and mesenteric
 lymph nodes.  No significant lymphadenopathy is present. There is no free air
 or fluid within the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  There is a small, left paramedian hernia, best
 seen on Series 2, Image 57.  There is a small bowel loop extending into this
 hernia sac.  There is no evidence of obstruction or dilatation of the small
 bowel.  Within the right paramedian anterior wall of the lower abdomen, the
 peritoneal lining appears redundant. These may also represent internal

 heart catheterization.  Request to evaluate pleural effusions and to rule out
 retroperitoneal bleed following cardiac catheter study.

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber

 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub

 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made. <question> Are there any bleeding spots on head CT?"	"subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum"	"of the nose.

 ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
 procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The
 potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and
 confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and
 placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and
 indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]
 protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a
 micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a
 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a
 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected
 and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire
 with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the
 skin with 0 silk suture.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated well.  A
 final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and
 no pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  Recent sternotomy with new chest trauma, assess for anterior rib
 fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained prior to and in arterial
 phase after the administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations as well as bilateral oblique reformations were prepared.

 COMPARISONS:  Coronary CTA, [**2190-2-3**].

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is normal in appearance.  Mediastinal calcifications
 likely reflect calcified lymph nodes which in conjunction with calcified
 granulomas in the lungs are likely reflective of prior granulomatous disease.
 The lungs are clear with the exception of bibasilar as well as linear right
 middle lobe atelectasis.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  The
 heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The aorta and major branches are
 patent.  Patient is status post reimplantation of anomalous right coronary

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 Comparison: [**2101-5-18**]

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases demonstrate
 large bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis. These have
 increased in size as compared to the prior study. Pacer wires are noted. There
 is no pericardial effusion. Allowing for the limitations of a non-contrast
 examination, the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney are
 normal. There is a 1 cm low attenuation focus within the left kidney, which
 most likely represents a small cyst. Stomach and proximal loops of small and
 large bowel are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or

 TRAUMA SERIES.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  There are low inspiratory volumes and overlying trauma
 board artifact.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 accounted for by these technical factors.  There is a rounded density along
 the right heart border - this likely represents vascular structures, but
 attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No gross CHF, focal
 contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  Some opacity overlies the

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet from ground.
 Patient with abdominal pain and nausea.

 COMPARISON:  Trauma chest radiograph performed at 4:04 p.m.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis after administration of 130 mL of IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reformatted
 images were then obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels appear intact.  No
 pericardial or pleural effusion is seen.  Aside from dependent atelectasis,
 the lungs appear clear.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is seen.  No
 lymphadenopathy is noted.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is free fluid of intermediate density in
 the perihepatic and perisplenic spaces as well as along both paracolic
 gutters.  In addition slightly higher density fluid is noted within the
 mesentery in the mid-to-lower abdomen, between loops of small bowel.  These
 findings are consistent with mesenteric injury and concerning for small bowel
 injury.  No free air is noted within the abdomen.

 The liver, gallbladder and pancreas appear intact.  Small linear hypolucency
 in the posterior spleen is noted, and while this may represent a grade 1
 laceration of the spleen, this could also represent a splenic cleft; a
 laceration of this size within the spleen would not account for the extent of
 hemoperitoneum.

 The adrenal glands, kidneys and ureters appear intact.  The abdominal aorta
 and major abdominal arteries appear intact.  The non-opacified stomach and
 colon appear unremarkable.  No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting CT size
 criteria for adenopathy.
 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Air is noted within the decompressed urinary
 bladder, with Foley catheter in place.  The prostate, seminal vesicles and

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital

 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries

 CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Subcutaneous gas tracks along the lateral and
 anterior soft tissues.  No pneumothoraces are identified. There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent passive atelectasis.  Two punctate
 high attenuation areas in the left lower lobe are likely granulomata.  No
 other opacities are seen within the lungs.  There is an NG tube extending

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius
 without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not
 aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to
 the right coronary artery.  The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of
 disease.  The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease.  The calcium score
 was 0.

 INDICATION:  66-year-old female with newly diagnosed CLL, here to evaluate for
 cervical lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso without contrast performed the same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the neck without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were
 generated and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  This study is limited by the absence of intravenous contrast.
 Allowing for this limitation, there are multiple prominent cervical lymph
 nodes at all levels and stations.  The majority of these lymph nodes measure
 up to 1 cm in short axis and meet CT size criteria for lymphadenopathy.  Even
 though a number of these lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT
 size criteria, the multiplicity and wide extent make them compatible with
 lymphadenopathy.

 The visualized upper mediastinum demonstrates numerous, enlarged lymph node
 conglomerates in the bilateral axillary regions measuring up to 20 x 15 mm in
 the right axilla and 27 x 23 mm in the left axilla.  Multiple superior
 mediastinal lymph nodes appear prominent.  The visualized lung apices are
 clear.  The central tracheobronchial tree is patent.

 The visualized posterior fossa is unremarkable.  The visualized paranasal
 sinuses and bilateral mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no acute cervical fracture or malalignment.  No
 suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified in the bone. <question> Are there any enlarged cervical lymphnodes?"	"multiple prominent cervical lymph

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries
 appear normal.

 TECHNIQUE:  A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.

 FINDINGS:
 Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**].  There is
 chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus.  Flow is seen in the
 internal cerebral veins.  The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the
 source images.  There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures
 bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns
 bilaterally.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal
 carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small
 aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and
 appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

 LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:
 There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

 The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be
 catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's
 breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels
 under general anesthesia. <question> Was any contrast seen on the imaging?"	no_answer	"The previous dictation has been lost

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2141-11-29**] at 12:58 p.m.

 HISTORY:  Assess chest tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of the right-sided chest tube
 with the distal tip directed cephalad and projecting near the superior margin
 of the mediastinum at the T5-T6 level.  The previously noted large right
 pneumothorax has been largely evacuated although residual remain with
 approximately 13 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation noted
 at the lung apex.  Similarly, a large left pneumothorax has also decreased in
 size though no chest tube is evident on that side.  The maximal visceral and
 parietal pleural separation on that side is approximately 7 mm.  Improved
 aeration results in decreased opacity at the lung hila.  Indwelling right
 internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are
 again evident and stable in course and position.  There is atherosclerotic
 disease of the aorta with evidence of prior CABG.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 within normal limits.  Retrocardiac opacity persists and pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded. <question> What is the location of chest tube?"	"right-sided chest tube

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia and back pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T1-
 weighted images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the
 neural foramina are well maintained.  Note is made of mild cervical
 spondylosis.

 of the mediastinum at the T5-T6 level.  The previously noted large right
 pneumothorax has been largely evacuated although residual remain with
 approximately 13 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation noted

 aeration results in decreased opacity at the lung hila.  Indwelling right
 internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are
 again evident and stable in course and position.  There is atherosclerotic

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How is the picc line placed?"	"A new

 PROCEDURE:  Placement of temporary hemodialysis catheter.

 ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After risks and benefits of the procedure as well as
 local anesthesia were explained, informed consent was obtained.  The patient
 was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
 The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture
 needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hard copies of the ultrasound were
 stored.  A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using
 flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the
 needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The
 wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035
 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC.  The 4.5
 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was
 placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ.  The
 dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary
 hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior

 HISTORY:  Alcoholic with hematocrit of 15 and fluid noted on fast exam.
 Evaluate for intraperitoneal hemorrhage versus ascites.

 No priors are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,
 and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric
 and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration
 of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A
 small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild
 colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall
 thickening involving the transverse and ascending colon is present.

 A mild-to-moderate amount of free fluid noted within the abdomen and pelvis is
 in characteristic distribution for ascites.  The fluid measures predominantly
 simple and less than the Hounsfield unit measurement of blood within the

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet off the ground.
 Per trauma team, patient is neurologically intact.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 MRI/MRA/MRV HEAD

 MRI HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were
 obtained.

 PRELIMINARY READ:  ""acute infarct of the right talamus and internal capsule""
 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59168**].

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as a prior MRI
 of the head from [**2114-9-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There are new small infarcts involving the right thalamus and
 possibly the posterior limb of the right internal capsule.  These infarcts
 show increased T2- and FLAIR signal, which suggests that they are not
 hyperacute.

 There is encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right frontal lobe and the
 left occipital lobe.  The previously seen large left parietooccipital
 hemorrhage has essentially resolved.  The previously seen intraventricular
 hemorrhage has also resolved.

 There is a moderate subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter T2
 hyperintensity which likely represent combination of old infarcts and old
 small vessel disease.

 There is gyriform mineralization of the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe,
 right parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe.  There is siderosis lining
 the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally as well as siderosis
 of the inferior cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.  Mineralization along a
 right frontal shunt tract is seen.  There is stable old hemorrhage within the
 body of the right lateral ventricle.

 The previously seen left to right shift of the normally midline structures and
 mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle have resolved.  The ventricles are
 normal in size.

 MRA/MRV HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  3D time-of-flight images of the intracranial arterial system as
 well as oblique 2D time-of-flight images of the intracranial venous system
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as prior MRV of
 the head from [**2114-9-13**] and prior CTA/CTV of the head from [**2114-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:  There is new abrupt termination of the right posterior cerebral
 artery at its P2 segment which is new since the prior studies.

 There is decreased signal within the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral
 arteries bilaterally as well as the proximal portion of the basilar artery,
 not significantly changed since the MR from [**2114-9-13**].  However, the CTA from
 [**2115-1-17**] shows normal enhancement of these arteries and a congenitally
 hypoplastic right vertebral artery.  Therefore, the MRA findings are most
 likely are artifactual or technical, and may relate to the small caliber of
 these vessels.

 The MRV shows no significant change since the prior studies.  There is partial
 thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and the left
 internal jugular vein.  There is near complete thrombosis of the superior
 sagittal sinus.  The right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**]

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 SOFT TISSUE:  No evidence of subcutaneous free air in the imaged portion of
 the soft tissue.  Please note that part of the soft tissue of the right pelvis
 was not imaged due to patient body habitus. <question> Do we notice any masses in the abdomen?"	"3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  73-year-old man with anaplastic thyroid cancer, requiring a
 new right-sided PICC line and removal of an existing left-sided PICC line.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2522**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**], the
 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 angiography suite, intubated, and sedated.  Patient was placed supine on the
 angiography table and right side of neck as well as existing catheter prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed.  An initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate position of
 the existing line.  After appropriate measurements were made, a subcutaneous
 tunnel was created from right anterior chest wall to the skin entry site of
 the existing catheter.  A 14 French AngioDynamics catheter measuring 19 cm
 tip-to-cuff is pulled through the tunnel, exiting at site of the pre-existing
 catheter.  Both ports of the original catheter were aspirated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire

 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital

 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This

 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in
 the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible
 recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of

 COMPARISON:  MRI dated [**2121-5-15**], PET/CT [**2121-6-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the neck was performed with
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted
 within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in
 appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of
 midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the
 left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.

 There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the
 airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,
 consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue
 attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion
 cannot be excluded.

 The osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative changes noted
 throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6.
 Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral

 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite
 and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest
 demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt
 was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its
 thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the
 Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was
 placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or

 FINDINGS:

 LUNG BASES:  The lung bases are clear, the heart is normal in size.

 ABDOMEN:  A hypodensity is again seen within segment V of the liver, increased
 in size compared with prior, now measuring 3.2 cm in its longest axis.  There
 is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder demonstrates
 dense layering material consistent with sludge.  The spleen appears normal.
 The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The distal esophagus,
 stomach, and duodenum contain contrast, and are otherwise normal in
 appearance.  There is no intraperitoneal free air.  Loops of small bowel are
 opacified by contrast, and appear to fistulize with a large soft tissue mass
 with central cavitary portion containing a gas-contrast/fluid level, as seen
 on the prior exam (3; 66).  The kidneys bilaterally demonstrate
 hydronephrosis, and hydroureter, unchanged from prior study.

 PELVIS:  A colostomy is seen, with an unchanged appearance compared with
 prior.  The left colon passes adjacent to, does not appear to communicate with
 a new area of soft tissue density containing mottled air, and an air-fluid
 level.  This collection extends through the abdominal musculature and fascia
 and into the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank.  The left psoas is

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia and back pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T1-
 weighted images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the
 neural foramina are well maintained.  Note is made of mild cervical
 spondylosis.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar

 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.
 The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU. <question> Are there any abnormalities following stenosis?"	"extensive intracranial

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 INDICATION: Status post MVA, car vs tree.

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a fracture of the right humeral head which is
 comminuted with impaction of the distal fracture fragment.  The fragmented
 humeral head is articulating within the glenoid fossa. A comminuted, but
 nondisplaced fracture of the right clavicle is also present.  There is
 widening of the right sternoclavicular joint. The underling subclavian vessels
 are patent, without evidence of surrounding hematoma.  No scapular fracture is
 seen. There are deformities of multiple ribs anteriorly, bilaterally,
 suggestive of traumatic injury. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
 spine.  No pelvic fractures are seen. Visualized portions of the proximal
 femurs are normal. <question> Is there any aortic arch injury?"	no evidence of traumatic aortic injury	"Minimal dependent changes are seen

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector scanning was performed of the pelvis without
 intravenous contrast.  Repeat imaging was performed in the axial plane after
 retrograde administration of 300 mL of dilute Optiray through the Foley
 catheter via gravity. Saggital and coronal reformations were reviewed.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is an aortobifemoral graft.  The
 Foley catheter is seen in the region of a decompressed urinary bladder.  There
 is residual contrast within multiple bladder diverticula within the pelvis.
 There is a small volume of free fluid layering dependently within the deep

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter
 was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How was the PEG tube placed?"	"G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was there resistance while placing the PICC line?"	"A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of

 FINDINGS:

 LUNG BASES:  The lung bases are clear, the heart is normal in size.

 ABDOMEN:  A hypodensity is again seen within segment V of the liver, increased
 in size compared with prior, now measuring 3.2 cm in its longest axis.  There
 is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder demonstrates

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How is the picc line placed?"	"A new

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural
 abnormalities characterized by a semi-translucent line with some locally
 increased sclerosis consistent with a transverse nondisplaced fracture,
 apparently now healed.  Again analysis of soft tissue structures does not
 disclose evidence for joint effusion.  Also on the left side the patient has
 extensive arterial wall calcifications.

 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 SOFT TISSUE:  No evidence of subcutaneous free air in the imaged portion of
 the soft tissue.  Please note that part of the soft tissue of the right pelvis
 was not imaged due to patient body habitus. <question> Was there evidence of acute process in the hips and knees?"	"No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant

 blindness.

 COMPARISON:  No previous studies here.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR,
 gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the head.  Two-dimensional
 time-of-flight MRV of the head.  Three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA of the
 head.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA of the neck.

 FINDINGS:

 HEAD MRI:  There is no acute infarction.  There are multiple foci of T2
 hyperintensity at the [**Doctor Last Name 107**]/white matter junction of the cerebral hemispheres
 bilaterally, as well as foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres, without associated contrast enhancement or mass effect.
 Similar lesions are also seen in both cerebellar hemispheres.  These are
 congruent with the history of previous thromboembolic infarctions.  There is
 no evidence of associated blood products.  The ventricles and sylvian fissures
 are slightly prominent for the patient's age, suggestive of volume loss.
 There is no evidence of white matter edema or other changes to suggest PRES.

 There is a small subretinal or subchoroidal collection in the lateral aspect
 of the right lobe, most likely a hematoma, with associated retinal detachment.
 The left globe is unremarkable.

 Prominence of the pituitary gland is normal in the postpartum setting.

 CT ABDOMEN.

 INDICATION:  Query Crohn's disease.  History of lower GI bleeding and distal
 ileal resection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis were
 performed after both oral and intravenous contrast.  Single-phase scanning was
 performed in the portal venous phase.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the previous CT dated [**2155-1-13**].

 LUNG BASES:  The lung bases are clear.

 CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, spleen, both kidneys, both adrenal glands and pancreas
 are normal.  The gallbladder is normal.  No adenopathy.  No free air or free
 fluid.  The previously seen hemoperitoneum has resolved.

 CT PELVIS:  A surgical suture line is identified in relation to the small
 bowel as seen on images 60, 61, 62, 63, series 2, in the right lower quadrant.
 The wall of this segment of distal ileum is moderately thickened.  This is a
 focal area of thickening.  The more proximal small bowel is of normal caliber.
 There are small subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes identified in the right
 iliac fossa.  There is evidence of creeping fat.  No collections.  No evidence
 of obstruction, as the oral contrast passes through and easily to the right
 colon.  The urinary bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate are normal.

 BONES:  There is very mild degenerative disease seen in relation to the
 thoracolumbar spine.  No worrisome lesions identified. <question> Was there evidence of Crohns in the terminal ileum?"	"wall of this segment of distal ileum is moderately thickened.  This is a

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST AND REFORMATIONS [**2109-1-19**].

 INDICATION:  Pneumoperitoneum with increasing right upper quadrant pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Following administration of 150 cc of Optiray for severe
 debilitation, CT was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
 Coronal reformations were created per CT enterography protocol.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2109-1-16**].

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Again, there are small bilateral pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis/minor consolidation at the bases, not
 significantly changed.  There is interval decrease in the amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema and pneumoperitoneum.  The percutaneous G tube pigtail
 terminates in the proximal duodenum.  The bowel loops are normal in caliber,
 without evidence of obstruction.  The liver, pancreas, spleen and adrenals are
 normal in appearance.  The gallbladder demonstrates vicarious excretion of IV
 contrast and a single dependent stone, unchanged.  There is no evidence of
 undue distention or wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.  There is
 no change in the multiple renal cysts, the largest on the right measuring 3 x
 2.6 cm and the largest on the left measures 3.8 x 3.8 cm.  There is no
 ascites.  There is marked atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, with
 eccentric mural thrombus.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Enteric contrast has reached the rectum.  The
 prostate is markedly enlarged and intrudes upon the posterior inferior wall of
 the bladder, measuring a maximal cross-section dimension of 5.8 x 5.3 cm.  The
 bladder is filled with urine though not frankly distended.  There is slight
 herniation of mesenteric fat within the right inguinal canal.

 Bone windows demonstrate mild degenerative change at the lower thoracic spine.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia and back pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T1-
 weighted images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the
 neural foramina are well maintained.  Note is made of mild cervical
 spondylosis.

 MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T2-

 FINDINGS:

 There is fatty replacement of much of the visualized marrow.

 At L1/2, there is a small central and left-sided disc herniation which indents
 the thecal sac minimally.  There is a mild disc bulge at L2/3.  The L3/4 disc

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  Post-pyloric tube placement.
 2.  PICC line placement.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite
 and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest
 demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt
 was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its
 thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the
 Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was
 placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down
 beyond the pylorus, with the tip terminating just prior to the ligament of
 Treitz.  The wire was removed and contrast injected, confirming this location.
 A final fluoroscopic view of the abdomen was obtained.  There were no
 immediate complications.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed
 per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its terminating in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.

 MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV
 Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient
 received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was
 obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of
 procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial
 fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube
 malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and
 under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used
 to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.
 Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was
 insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine
 administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was
 deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two
 additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used

 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.

 MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV
 Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient
 received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was
 obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of
 procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial
 fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube
 malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and
 under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used
 to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.
 Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was
 insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine
 administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was
 deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two
 additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used
 to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced.  Sequential
 fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French
 Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube.  The pigtail was formed within the stomach.  Contrast

 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.
 There is no lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted again
 consistent with history of peritoneal lavage.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is
 again noted as well as enlargement of the right ventricle consistent with
 right vocal cord paralysis. Extension of the mass into this region cannot be
 excluded.

 The tracheal stent is patent.  The lower esophagus is patulous and the
 previously described tracheal diverticulum is not seen on this examination.

 Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with partial fusion of
 C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.  The well-circumscribed lytic lesions within the
 C3 and C4 vertebral bodies have not changed in appearance.  No new osseous

 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Are the carotid blood vessels normal?"	"moderate left and milder

 LEFT HIP ASPIRATION, [**2134-4-16**]

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, leukocytosis and left hip pain.

 COMPARISON:  CT from same day and radiographs from same day.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Following discussion of the risks, benefits and
 alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained.
 Preprocedure timeout was performed confirming the patient identity, site, and
 side of the procedure to be performed.

 After standard sterile prep and local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, an
 18-gauge spinal needle was advanced into the left hip joint under intermittent
 fluoroscopic guidance.  No free aspirate could be obtained.  Intra-articular
 position was confirmed with a 4 mL Optiray 240 contrast.  10 mL of sterile
 saline was injected into the left hip joint and immediately re-aspirated
 yielding approximately 2.0 mL of clear fluid.  Samples were for requested
 analysis.

 The needle was removed, hemostasis achieved, and a dry sterile bandage was
 applied.

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar

 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

 INDICATION: Status post MVA, car vs tree.

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a fracture of the right humeral head which is
 comminuted with impaction of the distal fracture fragment.  The fragmented
 humeral head is articulating within the glenoid fossa. A comminuted, but
 nondisplaced fracture of the right clavicle is also present.  There is
 widening of the right sternoclavicular joint. The underling subclavian vessels
 are patent, without evidence of surrounding hematoma.  No scapular fracture is

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodules and
 known history of CLL.

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared
 to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most
 recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the
 spleen are persistent.

 There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate
 changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.

 Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.  The vast majority
 of previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground glass
 opacities have resolved or decreased in size.  On the other hand, multiple new
 but similar in appearance pulmonary nodules with center of solid density and
 surrounding ground glass halo have appeared:  4:36, 94, 109, 126, 143, 152,
 157, 165, and the largest one in the left lower lobe, 178, 7.7 mm in diameter.
 Some of the nodules have a discrete ground glass halo, some of them are solid,
 with slightly irregular contours.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%, in stomach and [**Last Name (un) **]. IV
 conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously
 under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's
 skin using 0 Prolene suture material. A Flexi-Track dressing was applied, and
 sterile gauze applied over the entry site.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the

 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 white blood cell count, of unknown etiology.  Please evaluate for abscess,
 mediastinitis or abdominal process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is stable herniation of colon through the
 right inguinal canal and new herniation of colon at the ostium of the left
 inguinal canal.  The colon is filled with stool without evidence of
 obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid
 or free air is detected within the pelvis.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is mild increased overlap of the osseous fragments
 of the sternotomy (2:28) suggesting possible movement at the sternotomy site.
 No focal fluid collections are detected within the tissues surrounding the
 sternotomy site.  There is multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar

 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is
 again noted as well as enlargement of the right ventricle consistent with
 right vocal cord paralysis. Extension of the mass into this region cannot be
 excluded.

 The tracheal stent is patent.  The lower esophagus is patulous and the

 Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with partial fusion of
 C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.  The well-circumscribed lytic lesions within the

 CT CYSTOGRAM

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector scanning was performed of the pelvis without
 intravenous contrast.  Repeat imaging was performed in the axial plane after
 retrograde administration of 300 mL of dilute Optiray through the Foley
 catheter via gravity. Saggital and coronal reformations were reviewed.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is an aortobifemoral graft.  The
 Foley catheter is seen in the region of a decompressed urinary bladder.  There
 is residual contrast within multiple bladder diverticula within the pelvis.
 There is a small volume of free fluid layering dependently within the deep
 pelvis. In addition, there are small foci of air within the deep pelvis
 consistent with recent history of Foley trauma.

 CT CYSTOGRAM WITH CONTRAST:  After retrograde filling of the bladder with 300
 mL of dilute Optiray, images were obtained.  The Foley catheter is within the
 urinary bladder.  The urinary bladder as well as numerous bladder diverticula
 are filled with contrast.  No extraluminal contrast is seen.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How is the picc line placed?"	"A new

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 fracture.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical 2.5 mm DCT axial sections were obtained from the skull
 base through the upper T3 level, sagittal and coronal reformations were
 prepared, and all images are viewed in bone, soft tissue and lung window on
 the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparisons on record.  For detailed description of
 the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate
 report of concurrent head CT.  There are ET and NG tubes in situ ""tamponading""
 the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation.  However, no
 gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified.  The cervical alignment
 is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal
 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet
 joint degenerative disease.  The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment
 is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base,
 itself.  No acute cervical spine fracture is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial
 articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively
 [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral
 spinal canal.  There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and
 more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other
 significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.

 There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical
 airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.  Noted are relatively
 symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either
 atelectasis or contusion; these are better characterized on the concurrent CT

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries
 appear normal.

 TECHNIQUE:  A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.

 FINDINGS:
 Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**].  There is
 chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus.  Flow is seen in the
 internal cerebral veins.  The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the
 source images.  There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse
 sinus.  There are large right transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Segments of
 the sigmoid sinus are much less well seen than previously, likely related to
 artifact based on the source images.  A small amount of flow is seen in the

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest without IV contrast followed by
 axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after Optiray IV contrast with
 multiplanar reformats.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  High-density material
 consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum
 insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic
 arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and
 superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma,
 measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density
 fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.

 The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at
 this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and
 likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around
 the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or
 transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great
 vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left
 vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left
 common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and
 airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular
 aneurysm or rupture.

 Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous
 changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left
 pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent
 atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the
 lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).
 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of
 the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,
 and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic duct is top normal in
 caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in
 the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of
 intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are
 bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring
 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.

 There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is
 tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures
 up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic
 change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,
 these vessels and their major branches appear patent.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present

 distended with contrast.  There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of
 a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or
 obstruction.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are numerous sigmoid
 diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and

 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is subcutaneous gas throughout the
 abdomen.  Gas is seen within the peritoneum.  There is a G-tube in place,
 without evidence of gas attenuation surrounding the subcutaneous portion.  A
 few small foci of gas attenuation are seen within the left and right upper

 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 INDICATION:  Elderly woman with altered mental status and atrial pacer wire
 abscess.  Status post fall with patellar fracture shown on previous x-ray.
 Follow-up examination.

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural
 abnormalities characterized by a semi-translucent line with some locally
 increased sclerosis consistent with a transverse nondisplaced fracture,
 apparently now healed.  Again analysis of soft tissue structures does not
 disclose evidence for joint effusion.  Also on the left side the patient has
 extensive arterial wall calcifications.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW:  There are low inspiratory volumes and overlying trauma
 board artifact.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 accounted for by these technical factors.  There is a rounded density along
 the right heart border - this likely represents vascular structures, but
 attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No gross CHF, focal
 contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  Some opacity overlies the
 lower trachea, but is of uncertain significance on this view.  The remainder
 of the trachea is within normal limits.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodules and
 known history of CLL.

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared
 to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most
 recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the
 spleen are persistent.

 There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate
 changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.

 Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.  The vast majority
 of previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground glass
 opacities have resolved or decreased in size.  On the other hand, multiple new

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement

 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 pulmonary nodule.

 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from [**2170-7-17**], CT torso with
 contrast from [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the chest without the
 administration of intravenous contrast material and 5 and 1.25 mm axial slices
 coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm
 mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to
 the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small
 pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an
 immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement
 in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with
 only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right
 lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed

 [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS:
 Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the
 procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a
 concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day. <question> Was the Gtube placed percutaneously?"	"guidewire was placed through

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the

 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity

 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without

 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm

 hyperintensity at the [**Doctor Last Name 107**]/white matter junction of the cerebral hemispheres
 bilaterally, as well as foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres, without associated contrast enhancement or mass effect.
 Similar lesions are also seen in both cerebellar hemispheres.  These are
 congruent with the history of previous thromboembolic infarctions.  There is
 no evidence of associated blood products.  The ventricles and sylvian fissures
 are slightly prominent for the patient's age, suggestive of volume loss.
 There is no evidence of white matter edema or other changes to suggest PRES.

 There is a small subretinal or subchoroidal collection in the lateral aspect
 of the right lobe, most likely a hematoma, with associated retinal detachment.
 The left globe is unremarkable.

 Prominence of the pituitary gland is normal in the postpartum setting.

 INDICATION:  85-year-old woman status post resection of left facial tumor,
 persistently tachycardic, desats to 80s on room air, rule out PE.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning
 is performed from the thoracic inlet through the diaphragm prior to and during
 dynamic injection of 100 cc of Optiray.

 No prior studies are available for comparison.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary,
 mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary arteries are well
 opacified.  There are no filling defects.  A small left pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  There is left
 lower lobe consolidation.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is noted. There
 are no lung nodules or masses.  An NG tube is identified.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal gallbladder, liver,
 and spleen.  A 1.2 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland measures 16 Hounsfield
 units, is thus indeterminate but most consistent with an adenoma.  A 3.5 cm
 hypodense lesion in the right kidney at mid pole measures 13 Hounsfield units

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical 2.5 mm DCT axial sections were obtained from the skull
 base through the upper T3 level, sagittal and coronal reformations were
 prepared, and all images are viewed in bone, soft tissue and lung window on
 the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparisons on record.  For detailed description of
 the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate
 report of concurrent head CT.  There are ET and NG tubes in situ ""tamponading""
 the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation.  However, no
 gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified.  The cervical alignment
 is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal
 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet
 joint degenerative disease.  The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment
 is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base,
 itself.  No acute cervical spine fracture is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial
 articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively
 [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral
 spinal canal.  There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and
 more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other
 significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.

 There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical
 airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.  Noted are relatively
 symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
 symphysis pubis without the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformations were obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Visualized lung bases are clear.
 There is no pleural effusion.  The visualized heart and pericardium are
 unremarkable, without pericardial effusion.

 The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Layering
 hyperdensity within the gallbladder likely reflects sludge.  There is a mild
 fullness of the right collecting system, without overt hydronephrosis.
 Moderately severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney and hydroureter, with
 associated atrophy of the left kidney, are stable in appearance.

 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital

 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs

 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the

 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,
 and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric
 and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration
 of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A
 small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild
 colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall
 thickening involving the transverse and ascending colon is present.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was the PICC placed?"	"tip positioned in the

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE

 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Is there any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage?"	"right posterior

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
 the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and laid in supine position.  The right neck was prepped and
 draped in standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were
 performed.  The patient's right neck was examined with ultrasound,
 demonstrating a patent and compressible right internal jugular vein.  This
 vein was cannulated with a micropuncture needle just above the clavicles. Pre-
 and post-cannulation images were obtained and printed.  A guidewire was
 advanced into the SVC through the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a

 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub
 centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
 Findings are in keeping with multiple  pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms
 and could be further evaluated with MRCP.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Mild degenerative changes are seen involving the
 thoracolumbar spine.  A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right ilium has the
 appearance of a benign bone island. <question> Is there signs of bleeding?"	"no significant
 perivenous hematoma"	"THORAX:

 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber

 INDICATION:  70-year-old man with anaplastic thyroid cancer and esophageal
 cancer with dysphagia requiring G-tube placement.

 PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**]
 attending radiologist.

 PROCEDURE:
 1.  Initial spot fluoroscopic image.
 2.  Removal of existing malpositioned nasogastric tube.
 3.  Placement of a 5 French catheter into the stomach.
 4.  Placement of a 12 French percutaneous Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] gastrostomy tube and 3
 T-tacks.
 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.

 MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV
 Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient
 received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was
 obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of
 procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial
 fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube
 malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and
 under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used
 to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.
 Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was
 insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine
 administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was
 deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two
 additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used
 to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced.  Sequential
 fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French
 Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube.  The pigtail was formed within the stomach.  Contrast
 injection confirmed location.  The T-tacks were secured to the skin with 0

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.

 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is stable herniation of colon through the
 right inguinal canal and new herniation of colon at the ostium of the left
 inguinal canal.  The colon is filled with stool without evidence of
 obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid
 or free air is detected within the pelvis.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is mild increased overlap of the osseous fragments
 of the sternotomy (2:28) suggesting possible movement at the sternotomy site.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in
 the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible
 recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-

 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during and after
 the uneventful administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 mL) of gadolinium-DTPA.  900
 mL of VoLumen was also administered orally.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformats and subtraction images provided multiple

 ileum causing an irregular lumen consistent with bowel wall invasion.  This
 lesion abuts and also likely involves the rectal wall (201:73).  There is near
 obliteration of the lumen due to mass effect but only minimal obstructive
 dilation of small bowel loops proximally.  The mass causes abrupt narrowing of
 the distal left ureter, moderate left hydronephrosis and mild left kidney

 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in

 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS:
 Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the
 procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a
 concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day. <question> was the placement of G tube successful?"	Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms	"a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter

 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental
 levels bilaterally.  There is extensive atelectasis involving the right middle
 lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete
 collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging
 along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent
 hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  30-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant with TTP, requiring
 placement of temporary triple-lumen pheresis line with VIP port.

 OPERATORS:  Procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 896**] (fellow).  Dr.
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and  reviewed the study.

 ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
 procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The
 potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and
 confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and
 placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and
 indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]
 protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a
 micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a
 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a
 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected
 and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire
 with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the
 skin with 0 silk suture.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated well.  A
 final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and
 no pneumothorax.

 The patient was then placed on a gurney and the indwelling right pheresis
 catheter was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complication. <question> Was the triple lumen pheresis line placed?"	catheter was placed	"wire

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST AND REFORMATIONS [**2109-1-19**].

 INDICATION:  Pneumoperitoneum with increasing right upper quadrant pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Following administration of 150 cc of Optiray for severe
 debilitation, CT was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
 Coronal reformations were created per CT enterography protocol.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2109-1-16**].

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Again, there are small bilateral pleural effusions
 with compressive atelectasis/minor consolidation at the bases, not
 significantly changed.  There is interval decrease in the amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema and pneumoperitoneum.  The percutaneous G tube pigtail
 terminates in the proximal duodenum.  The bowel loops are normal in caliber,
 without evidence of obstruction.  The liver, pancreas, spleen and adrenals are
 normal in appearance.  The gallbladder demonstrates vicarious excretion of IV
 contrast and a single dependent stone, unchanged.  There is no evidence of
 undue distention or wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.  There is
 no change in the multiple renal cysts, the largest on the right measuring 3 x
 2.6 cm and the largest on the left measures 3.8 x 3.8 cm.  There is no
 ascites.  There is marked atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, with
 eccentric mural thrombus.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Enteric contrast has reached the rectum.  The
 prostate is markedly enlarged and intrudes upon the posterior inferior wall of
 the bladder, measuring a maximal cross-section dimension of 5.8 x 5.3 cm.  The
 bladder is filled with urine though not frankly distended.  There is slight
 herniation of mesenteric fat within the right inguinal canal.

 Bone windows demonstrate mild degenerative change at the lower thoracic spine.

 1THYROID BIOPSY

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient who underwent a CT examination of the neck
 during an episode of an infected tooth.  At that time, an incidental thyroid
 nodule was noted on the right side and ultrasound performed.  This
 demonstrated bilateral nodules, with the dominant nodule on the right side.
 The patient presents for fine needle aspiration.

 FINDINGS:  As previously noted, most significant finding is one of the
 dominant nodules in the right thyroid lobe measuring 33.3 x 26.9 x 31.0 mm.
 This has a well defined halo, is isoechoic with some spongy components.  Color
 Doppler reveals only peripheral vascularity.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Are the carotid blood vessels normal?"	"moderate left and milder
