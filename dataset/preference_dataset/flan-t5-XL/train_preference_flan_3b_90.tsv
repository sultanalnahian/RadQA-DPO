 INDICATION:  81-year-old male with mediastinal wound dehiscence and elevated
 white blood cell count, of unknown etiology.  Please evaluate for abscess,
 mediastinitis or abdominal process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2193-1-15**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT THORAX:

 No suspicious pulmonary nodule is seen.  No other pulmonary abnormality is
 identified.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

 CT ABDOMEN:

 No focal abnormality is identified within the liver on this study performed
 without intravenous contrast.  The adrenal glands, pancreas, and spleen appear
 normal.  A small area of accessory splenic tissue is again identified adjacent
 to the pancreatic tail.  There is hydronephrosis of the left kidney and
 dilatation of the left ureter to the level of the pelvic brim, unchanged since
 the previous CT.  A right extrarenal pelvis is again identified.  No focal
 abnormality is seen in the right kidney. Several small mesenteric lymph nodes
 are again identified in the left lower abdomen (series 2, image 81), with
 largest measuring 10 mm x 8 mm diameter in comparison to 13 mm x 11 mm on
 prior scan. Although this study was performed without intravenous contrast,
 apparent narrowing of the celiac artery at its origin from the aorta (series

 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub
 centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
 Findings are in keeping with multiple  pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms
 and could be further evaluated with MRCP.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Mild degenerative changes are seen involving the
 thoracolumbar spine.  A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right ilium has the
 appearance of a benign bone island. <question> Is there evidence of pneumonia?"	no_answer	bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.

 HISTORY:  Anaplastic thyroid cancer.  Restaging.

 TECHNIQUE:  Continuous axial images through the neck were performed without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is
 again noted as well as enlargement of the right ventricle consistent with
 right vocal cord paralysis. Extension of the mass into this region cannot be
 excluded.

 The tracheal stent is patent.  The lower esophagus is patulous and the
 previously described tracheal diverticulum is not seen on this examination.

 Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with partial fusion of
 C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.  The well-circumscribed lytic lesions within the
 C3 and C4 vertebral bodies have not changed in appearance.  No new osseous
 lesions are identified.  There is mucosal thickening of multiple left ethmoid

 HISTORY:  43-year-old woman, with ovarian cancer, with extensive
 intra-abdominal involvement.  Now pain, fever and white count elevation.
 Assess for interval change.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple CT abdomen and pelvis with latest on [**2193-8-29**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis after only administration of oral contrast.  No IV contrast was
 administered secondary to patient's acute renal failure.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  The visualized lung bases are clear
 without pleural effusions.  The absence of IV contrast significantly limits
 evaluation of intra-abdominal organs.  The liver is noted with a geographic
 hypodensity in segment V, incompletely assessed, but grossly unchanged
 compared to the study 7 days ago.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted with small amount of hyperdense material
 layering in the dependent portion, compatible with gallstone.  There is no CT
 evidence of acute cholecystitis.  The adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen is
 grossly unremarkable.  The splenic vein is markedly calcified.

 Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is moderate-to-severe but relatively unchanged
 in severity compared to prior.  The stomach, duodenum and proximal loops of
 small bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is free oral contrast passage
 through and reaching up to the mid descending colon.  There is no free air or
 air in the intra-abdominal cavity.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is marked interval increase and spread
 of subcutaneous air along the left posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with
 interval aggressive necrosis of the underlying soft tissues.  Hyperdense
 material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64,
 concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent
 bowel.  Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also
 suggestive of microperforation.  There is no definite bowel obstruction.
 Colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant.  The large collection of
 soft tissue and fluid is again noted in the mid pelvis, amorphous and
 difficult to assess the boundary.  The asymmetrically enlarged left psoas
 muscle, incompletely evaluated without IV contrast, either represent an
 intramuscular mass or abscess.

 Given the history of sudden onset left abdominal pain, splenic infarction could
 be considered.  However, in the most recent cross-sectional imaging of the upper
 abdomen (on prior chest CT), no significant abnormalities were noted in this
 area, and cross-sectional examination of the abdomen such as an abdominal CT
 could be performed for further evaluation of this region and for anatomic
 correlation.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 45**] on [**2196-9-26**].

 CMR Technical Information:
 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
 2) Function: Breath-hold cine Steady-state free precession (SSFP) images were
 acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis,
 contiguous short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the
 left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
 4) Perfusion/Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
 segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition, short-axis, four chamber and
 two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
 total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 Magnevist  solution).


 Findings:
 The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.

 Structure and Function
 There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial
 fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal
 intensity.  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small
 (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were
 identified in their customary positions.  The diameters of the ascending
 aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal.  The left
 atrial AP dimension was mildly increased.  The left atrial dimensions in the
 4-chamber view was mildly increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged.  The left
 ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated.  The
 calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%,
 with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global
 hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of
 the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricular mass was normal.
 The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated
 right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional
 and global systolic function.
 The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.

 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
 significant aortic regurgitation.  There was no significant mitral
 regurgitation.  The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow
 demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.

 Viability
 There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal
 portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral
 segments, and the apex.   The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with
 poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.
  The infarct/LV mass ratio was 0.33. <question> Was there evidence of myocardial infarction?"	left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%, with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of the inferior and inferolateral walls	no_answer

 ULTRASOUND-GUIDED CORE BIOPSY, LEFT BREAST:  Preprocedure imaging again
 demonstrates an approximately 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the
 retroareolar left breast.  Targeted ultrasound of the left axilla was
 performed, demonstrating several normal-appearing fatty replaced lymph nodes.

 Following explanation of the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives,
 written informed consent was obtained with the assistance of a Russian
 interpreter.  A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient
 identifiers.

 Using standard aseptic technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under
 ultrasound guidance, multiple core biopsies were obtained of the hypoechoic
 mass in the retroareolar left breast using a 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded
 biopsy device.  A percutaneous clip was subsequently placed at the site of
 biopsy under ultrasound guidance.  The needle was removed and hemostasis was
 achieved.

 Post-procedure mammogram demonstrates accurate deployment of the percutaneous
 clip in the retroareolar left mass.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.  The
 patient was discharged home with standard post-biopsy instruction. <question> Was there evidence to confirm breast cancer?"	approximately 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the retroareolar left breast.

 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 Bone windows show degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, bilateral
 L5 pars defects and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  A compression

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:

 There is a 11 x 6 millimeter hypoattenuating left thyroid nodule (3:4).  There
 are borderline prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size
 criteria for pathologic enlargement.  For example, one in the AP window
 measures 6 millimeters (3:23).  A precarinal lymph node measures 8 mm (3:24).
 A subcarinal lymph node measures 14-mm.  There is no supraclavicular or
 axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 coronary vessels.  The heart size is normal and a small amount of pericardial
 fluid is present.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. They are non
 loculated and nonhemorrhagic.  On background emphysema, there are several
 ground-glass nodules, with a peripheral distribution, most concentrated in the
 right middle lobe.  The largest measures 10 x 5 millimeters in the right
 middle lobe (3:  34).  Another indistinct cluster can be seen also in the
 peripheral right middle lobe, measuring 12 x 11 millimeters (3: 39).  There
 are several in the lingula and left lower lobe as well.  Airspace
 consolidation with air bronchograms are present in the basilar aspect of the
 bilateral lower lobes (3:  46, 49).

 ABDOMEN:

 There is an 8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver.  The
 gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen appear normal.  There may be
 a tiny gallstone.  There are two subcentimeter right renal hypodensities, 1 in
 the upper pole and 1 in the lower pole, both of which are too small to
 characterize.  The there are no stones or hydronephrosis and the kidneys
 enhance normally otherwise.  The portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins are
 patent.  The abdominal aorta is heavily calcified but is of normal caliber,
 with patent main branches.  The small bowel appears normal.

 There is focal wall thickening of the cecum, at the ileocecal valve (601 b:

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.
 The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU. <question> Are there any abnormalities following stenosis?"	extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was there resistance while placing the PICC line?"	A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.

 LEFT HIP ASPIRATION, [**2134-4-16**]

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever, leukocytosis and left hip pain.

 COMPARISON:  CT from same day and radiographs from same day.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Following discussion of the risks, benefits and
 alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained.
 Preprocedure timeout was performed confirming the patient identity, site, and
 side of the procedure to be performed.

 After standard sterile prep and local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, an
 18-gauge spinal needle was advanced into the left hip joint under intermittent
 fluoroscopic guidance.  No free aspirate could be obtained.  Intra-articular
 position was confirmed with a 4 mL Optiray 240 contrast.  10 mL of sterile
 saline was injected into the left hip joint and immediately re-aspirated
 yielding approximately 2.0 mL of clear fluid.  Samples were for requested

 HISTORY:  84-year-old male with chest and shoulder pain.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest without IV contrast followed by
 axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after Optiray IV contrast with
 multiplanar reformats.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  High-density material
 consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum
 insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic
 arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and
 superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma,
 measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density
 fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.

 The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at
 this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and
 likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around
 the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or
 transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great
 vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left
 vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left
 common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and
 airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular
 aneurysm or rupture.

 Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous
 changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left
 pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent
 atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the
 lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).
 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of
 the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,
 and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic duct is top normal in
 caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in
 the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of
 intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are
 bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring
 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.

 There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is
 tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures
 up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic
 change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,
 these vessels and their major branches appear patent.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present
 within the prostate gland, which is enlarged.  The urinary bladder is
 distended with contrast.  There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of
 a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or
 obstruction.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are numerous sigmoid
 diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures
 bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns
 bilaterally.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal
 carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small
 aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and
 appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

 LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:
 There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

 The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be
 catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's
 breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels
 under general anesthesia. <question> Do we notice any bleeding vessel in the brain?"	no_answer	subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns bilaterally

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius
 without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not
 aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to
 the right coronary artery.  The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of
 disease.  The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease.  The calcium score
 was 0.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen. <question> Does the neck mass seem to be metastasized?"	no_answer	large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How is the picc line placed?"

 multiplanar reformats.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  High-density material
 consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum
 insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic
 arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and
 superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma,
 measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density
 fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.

 The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at
 this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and
 likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around
 the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or
 transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great
 vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left
 vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left
 common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and
 airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular
 aneurysm or rupture.

 Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous
 changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left
 pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent
 atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the
 lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).
 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of
 the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,

 caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in
 the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of
 intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are
 bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring
 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.

 There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is
 tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures
 up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic
 change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,
 these vessels and their major branches appear patent.

 INDICATION:  66-year-old woman with CLL, recent viral pneumonia with new
 pulmonary nodule.

 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from [**2170-7-17**], CT torso with
 contrast from [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the chest without the
 administration of intravenous contrast material and 5 and 1.25 mm axial slices
 coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm
 mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to
 the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small
 pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an
 immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement
 in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with
 only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right
 lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this
 exam.  However, there are multiple new nodules with surrounding halos since
 the prior study.  For example, 5-mm right lower lobe nodule (4:174), 3-mm left
 lower lobe nodule (4:144), 2 mm left lower lobe nodule (4:134), 4 mm lingular
 nodule (4:116) are new. In immunocompromise host, the new nodules with
 surrounding halos are concerning for fungal infection.  However, if patient is
 not immunocompromised, differential includes viral infection, new bacterial
 infection, COP or less likely vasculitis.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.

 This study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic structures
 but shows multiple calcifications in the spleen, unchanged from prior exam.

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter
 was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How was the PEG tube placed?"	G-tube was placed over the wire.

 STUDY:  CT torso.

 INDICATION:  81-year-old male with mediastinal wound dehiscence and elevated
 white blood cell count, of unknown etiology.  Please evaluate for abscess,
 mediastinitis or abdominal process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is stable herniation of colon through the
 right inguinal canal and new herniation of colon at the ostium of the left
 inguinal canal.  The colon is filled with stool without evidence of
 obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 MR VENOGRAPHY

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along

 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line
 was removed.  A sterile dressing was again applied. <question> Was the PICC line placed under IR?"	successfully positioned	4 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal SVC

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  Post-pyloric tube placement.
 2.  PICC line placement.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite
 and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest
 demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt
 was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its
 thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the
 Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was
 placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down

 A final fluoroscopic view of the abdomen was obtained.  There were no
 immediate complications.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed
 per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its terminating in the cavoatrial

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast chest CT.

 FINDINGS:  The superior poles of the thyroid gland are incompletely imaged.
 The gland is diffusely enlarged, with retrotracheal extent of the right lobe.
 Multiple calcifications - containing thyroid nodules are present.  The trachea
 is narrowed to two thirds of its normal diameter at the level of the enlarged
 thyroid.  More distally, the tracheobronchial tree is patent to the

 ANESTEHSIA: Local lidocaine

 PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
 the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and laid in supine position.  The right neck was prepped and
 draped in standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were
 performed.  The patient's right neck was examined with ultrasound,
 demonstrating a patent and compressible right internal jugular vein.  This
 vein was cannulated with a micropuncture needle just above the clavicles. Pre-
 and post-cannulation images were obtained and printed.  A guidewire was
 advanced into the SVC through the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a
 micropuncture sheath.  The inner dilator and wire were removed and exchanged
 for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire, which was extended down into the upper right atrium.  The
 sheath was exchanged for a 14 French dilator. Following dilation, the 15 cm
 triple lumen dialysis/pheresis catheter including VIP port was advanced over
 the wire with tip terminating in the high right atrium. The wire was removed,
 the catheter flushed.  A post- procedure fluoroscopic image of the tip
 confirms the tip location in the high right atrium.  The catheter was secured
 to the skin with 0-0 silk suture and dressed appropriately.  There were no
 immediate complications. <question> Has the dialysis line been placed?"	15 cm triple lumen dialysis/pheresis catheter including VIP port was advanced over the wire with tip terminating in the high right atrium	tip terminating in the high right atrium

 MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with Type II dens fracture on CT of the spine.
 For further evaluation.  The patient has right-sided weakness.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and STIR sagittal and gradient echo axial images of the
 cervical spine were acquired.  The axial images are limited due to motion.

 FINDINGS:  As suggested by history, there is a linear signal abnormality
 through the dens indicating fracture.  The fracture corresponds to a Type II
 fracture.  There is no malalignment seen at the fracture site.  The atlanto-
 odontoid distance is well maintained.  The spinal canal dimensions at C1 and
 C2 level are also maintained.

 Degenerative changes are seen at C3-4 and C4-5 levels.

 At C5-5 and C6-7 levels there is moderate spinal stenosis with mild extrinsic
 compression of the spinal cord.  The spinal stenosis is secondary to disc
 bulging and ligamentous thickening.

 At C7-T1 and inferiorly to T3-4 degenerative changes are identified without
 spinal stenosis.

 pulmonary nodule.

 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from [**2170-7-17**], CT torso with
 contrast from [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the chest without the
 administration of intravenous contrast material and 5 and 1.25 mm axial slices
 coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm
 mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to
 the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small
 pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an
 immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement
 in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with
 only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right
 lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this
 exam.  However, there are multiple new nodules with surrounding halos since
 the prior study.  For example, 5-mm right lower lobe nodule (4:174), 3-mm left
 lower lobe nodule (4:144), 2 mm left lower lobe nodule (4:134), 4 mm lingular
 nodule (4:116) are new. In immunocompromise host, the new nodules with
 surrounding halos are concerning for fungal infection.  However, if patient is
 not immunocompromised, differential includes viral infection, new bacterial
 infection, COP or less likely vasculitis.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.

 This study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic structures
 but shows multiple calcifications in the spleen, unchanged from prior exam.

 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of

 HISTORY:  63-year-old male patient status post frontal bone fracture repair.

 TECHNIQUE:  5-mm axial images from the skull base to the vertex obtained
 without intravenous contrast administration.

 Comparison made to a prior CT of the sinuses dated [**2140-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  There is persistent pneumocephalus seen along the anterior frontal
 convexities.  Given that the pneumocephalus has persisted since the prior
 study on [**10-7**], the finding is of concern for perhaps a connection of
 the intracranial structures with the sinuses.  There is a small discontinuity
 of the inner plate of the frontal sinus, which could perhaps represent a
 connection.  However, better evaluation of this could be performed with a
 facial CT scan, as it has thinner images through the bones of the facial bone.
 There is mild flattening of the sulci caused by the pneumocephalus.  The left

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are

 is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal
 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet
 joint degenerative disease.  The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment
 is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base,
 itself.  No acute cervical spine fracture is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial
 articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively
 [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral
 spinal canal.  There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and
 more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other
 significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.

 There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical
 airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.  Noted are relatively
 symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either
 atelectasis or contusion; these are better characterized on the concurrent CT
 torso.

 COMMENT:  Findings posted to the ED dashboard. <question> Was there evidence of fracture?"	No acute cervical spine fracture	extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures
"<context> FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made. <question> Are there any bleeding spots on head CT?"	subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.

 OPERATORS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 501**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 411**] [**Doctor Last Name 412**].

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  Post-pyloric tube placement.
 2.  PICC line placement.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite
 and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest
 demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt
 was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its
 thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the
 Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was
 placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down
 beyond the pylorus, with the tip terminating just prior to the ligament of
 Treitz.  The wire was removed and contrast injected, confirming this location.
 A final fluoroscopic view of the abdomen was obtained.  There were no
 immediate complications.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed
 per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its terminating in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was the PICC line placed on the right side?"	right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a linear area of decreased
 attenuation within segments V, VI and VIII of the liver, consistent with a
 liver laceration.  Additionally, there is a small amount of dense fluid,
 consistent with blood, adjacent to the inferior tip of the spleen, and along
 the anterior surface of the liver.  The portal vein is intact.  The
 gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas are within normal
 limits.  No free intra-abdominal air is seen.  The bowel is normal, without
 evidence of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.  No mesenteric free fluid is
 noted.  The vascular structures are intact, without any evidence of periaortic
 fluid or injury.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is seen within the

 INDICATION:  Elderly woman with altered mental status and atrial pacer wire
 abscess.  Status post fall with patellar fracture shown on previous x-ray.
 Follow-up examination.

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural
 abnormalities characterized by a semi-translucent line with some locally
 increased sclerosis consistent with a transverse nondisplaced fracture,
 apparently now healed.  Again analysis of soft tissue structures does not
 disclose evidence for joint effusion.  Also on the left side the patient has
 extensive arterial wall calcifications.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen. <question> How is the neck mass on PET-CT?"	large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures
 bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns
 bilaterally.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal
 carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small
 aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and
 appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

 LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:
 There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

 The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be
 catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's
 breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels
 under general anesthesia. <question> How are the carotid blood vessels?"	small aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery	No significant atherosclerotic disease

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  30-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant with TTP, requiring
 placement of temporary triple-lumen pheresis line with VIP port.

 OPERATORS:  Procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 896**] (fellow).  Dr.
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and  reviewed the study.

 ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
 procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The
 potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and
 confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and
 placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and
 indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]
 protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a
 micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a
 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a
 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected
 and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire
 with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the
 skin with 0 silk suture.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated well.  A
 final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and
 no pneumothorax.

 The patient was then placed on a gurney and the indwelling right pheresis
 catheter was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 ULTRASOUND-GUIDED CORE BIOPSY, LEFT BREAST:  Preprocedure imaging again
 demonstrates an approximately 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the
 retroareolar left breast.  Targeted ultrasound of the left axilla was
 performed, demonstrating several normal-appearing fatty replaced lymph nodes.

 Following explanation of the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives,
 written informed consent was obtained with the assistance of a Russian
 interpreter.  A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient
 identifiers.

 Using standard aseptic technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under
 ultrasound guidance, multiple core biopsies were obtained of the hypoechoic
 mass in the retroareolar left breast using a 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded
 biopsy device.  A percutaneous clip was subsequently placed at the site of
 biopsy under ultrasound guidance.  The needle was removed and hemostasis was
 achieved.

 Post-procedure mammogram demonstrates accurate deployment of the percutaneous
 clip in the retroareolar left mass.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.  The

 HISTORY:  43-year-old female with history of ovarian cancer, with small bowel
 involvement, presenting with nausea and vomiting.  Evaluate for small-bowel
 obstruction.

 COMPARISON:  [**2192-12-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
 symphysis pubis without the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformations were obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Visualized lung bases are clear.
 There is no pleural effusion.  The visualized heart and pericardium are
 unremarkable, without pericardial effusion.

 The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Layering
 hyperdensity within the gallbladder likely reflects sludge.  There is a mild
 fullness of the right collecting system, without overt hydronephrosis.
 Moderately severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney and hydroureter, with
 associated atrophy of the left kidney, are stable in appearance.

 There is no free air or free fluid.  Mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
 (2:45) measure 13 mm in short axis, and are similar to prior study.  A lymph
 node along the right iliac chain (2:62) measures 11 mm in short axis

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A pelvic mass is slightly larger in
 size compared to [**2192-12-4**].  Again noted is an ileal loop that drapes
 over the mass with a loss of the fat plane.  There is a new focus of enteric
 contrast that extends into the mass (2:70), with foci of air also seen within
 the substance of the mass(2:73), concerning for a fistula between the adjacent
 ileum and the mass.

 There is a Hartmann's pouch, with a left lower quadrant colostomy.  There are
 dilated loops of small bowel proximally, measuring up to 3.5 cm; however,
 contrast is seen to extend into the cecum.  The findings are most suggestive
 of a partial small-bowel obstruction.  There is a small parastomal hernia
 containing a single loop of small bowel.

 The urinary bladder and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic free
 fluid.

 INDICATION:  69-year-old woman with alcohol abuse, who presents with jaundice
 and elevated bilirubin, unclear if this represents acute on chronic alcoholic
 hepatitis versus other etiology of hepatitis.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 1368**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 3014**], and [**Doctor Last Name 167**],
 the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout.

 MEDICATIONS: 1 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of Fentanyl were administered
 via divided doses for moderate conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic
 monitoring throught the 45 minute intraservice time ; 1 gram of Ancef was
 admninistered for antibiotic prophylaxis;

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After written informed consent was obtained from the
 patient explaining the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure, the
 patient was placed supine on the angiography table, and the right neck was
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout
 was performed.  Local anesthesia was introduced using 1% lidocaine.  Using
 ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured.  A 0.018
 guide wire was advanced through the needle, and the needle was exchanged for a
 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The wire and inner dilator were removed, and
 a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire was advanced through the micropuncture sheath into the IVC
 under fluoroscopic guidance.  The micropuncture sheath was then exchanged for
 a 9 French 45 cm [**Last Name (un) 67**] tip sheath.  Using a combination of a 5 F MPA catheter
 and a Glidewire, access was obtained into the right hepatic vein under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The guide wire was exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire,
 and the catheter removed, and a Cook transjugular liver core biopsy set was
 used to perform three passes into the right lobe of the liver, and tissue
 samples were obtained.  The biopsy set was removed and then the catheter and
 vascular sheath, and manual compression was held until hemostasis was
 achieved.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post-

 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs with the most recent from [**2129-12-27**].

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  A right-sided PICC line is new since the
 prior exam and appears coiled in the axilla with the remainder of the catheter
 coarsing medially.  Left-sided pacemaker is in place. The tip of the
 ventricular lead of the cardiac pacer is not well seen which may be secondary
 to motion. Right internal jugular venous catheter with the tip at the

 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made. <question> Is there evidence of bleeding?"	subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.

There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved, though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on these 2.5 mm sections). The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with fluid in the aditus ad antrum	extensive subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries
 appear normal.

 TECHNIQUE:  A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.

 FINDINGS:
 Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**].  There is
 chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus.  Flow is seen in the
 internal cerebral veins.  The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the
 source images.  There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse
 sinus.  There are large right transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Segments of
 the sigmoid sinus are much less well seen than previously, likely related to
 artifact based on the source images.  A small amount of flow is seen in the

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This

 FINDINGS:  There is persistent pneumocephalus seen along the anterior frontal

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.
 The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU. <question> How is the blood flow in basilar artery?"	no filling of the basilar	no_answer

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  73-year-old man with anaplastic thyroid cancer, requiring a
 new right-sided PICC line and removal of an existing left-sided PICC line.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2522**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**], the
 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line
 was removed.  A sterile dressing was again applied. <question> Was the PICC placement successful?"	successfully positioned	successfully positioned in the distal SVC

 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the

 MRI/MRA/MRV HEAD

 MRI HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were
 obtained.

 PRELIMINARY READ:  ""acute infarct of the right talamus and internal capsule""
 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59168**].

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as a prior MRI
 of the head from [**2114-9-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There are new small infarcts involving the right thalamus and
 possibly the posterior limb of the right internal capsule.  These infarcts
 show increased T2- and FLAIR signal, which suggests that they are not
 hyperacute.

 There is encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right frontal lobe and the
 left occipital lobe.  The previously seen large left parietooccipital
 hemorrhage has essentially resolved.  The previously seen intraventricular
 hemorrhage has also resolved.

 There is a moderate subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter T2
 hyperintensity which likely represent combination of old infarcts and old
 small vessel disease.

 There is gyriform mineralization of the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe,
 right parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe.  There is siderosis lining
 the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally as well as siderosis
 of the inferior cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.  Mineralization along a
 right frontal shunt tract is seen.  There is stable old hemorrhage within the
 body of the right lateral ventricle.

 The previously seen left to right shift of the normally midline structures and
 mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle have resolved.  The ventricles are
 normal in size.

 MRA/MRV HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  3D time-of-flight images of the intracranial arterial system as
 well as oblique 2D time-of-flight images of the intracranial venous system
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as prior MRV of
 the head from [**2114-9-13**] and prior CTA/CTV of the head from [**2114-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:  There is new abrupt termination of the right posterior cerebral
 artery at its P2 segment which is new since the prior studies.

 There is decreased signal within the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral
 arteries bilaterally as well as the proximal portion of the basilar artery,
 not significantly changed since the MR from [**2114-9-13**].  However, the CTA from
 [**2115-1-17**] shows normal enhancement of these arteries and a congenitally
 hypoplastic right vertebral artery.  Therefore, the MRA findings are most
 likely are artifactual or technical, and may relate to the small caliber of
 these vessels.

 The MRV shows no significant change since the prior studies.  There is partial
 thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and the left
 internal jugular vein.  There is near complete thrombosis of the superior
 sagittal sinus.  The right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**]

    30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2189-8-26**]);
 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74% <question> Is there any sign of ischemia?"	reversible, mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for
 right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours
 between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural
 hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side. <question> Was there any evidence of fracture?"

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior
 surgeries.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is marked cardiac enlargement.  It involves mostly a left
 ventricular prominence to the left and posteriorly but also a moderate degree
 of left atrial enlargement can be identified with double contour on the
 frontal view and bulge posteriorly on the lateral projection.  The thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated and calcium deposits are seen in the

 calcifications in the aortic valve area, but somewhat obscured by overlying
 vascular structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Somewhat irregular peripheral
 pulmonary vascular pattern and slightly low positioned diaphragms are
 suggestive of some degree of COPD, but acute parenchymal infiltrates are not

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen. <question> What is the mass within the patient's neck?"	large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was there resistance while placing the PICC line?"	A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x
 1.0 cm (2:64).

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.  Clips
 are seen in the sigmoid.  There is no free fluid.  Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes
 measure up to 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right (2:113) and 1.8 x 4.3 cm at the left

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid

 HISTORY:  43-year-old female with ovarian cancer and colostomy, now with
 nausea, vomiting, and chills.

 STUDY:  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis; coronal and sagittal
 reformatted images were also generated.

 COMPARISON:  [**2193-4-30**].

 FINDINGS:  The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appear unremarkable.

 In this limited non-contrast study, again is seen in segment V of the liver an
 area of hypodensity measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.6 cm.  The liver shows no
 evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Within the gallbladder, there is
 dense layering material most consistent with sludge.  The spleen is normal in
 size and appearance.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Both
 kidneys demonstrate marked hydronephrosis that appears unchanged from previous
 study.  Contrast is noted throughout the small bowel and most of the proximal
 colon that does not quite reach the ostomy.  Within the opacified region of
 bowel loops, no evidence of obstruction is seen.  No free air or free fluid is
 seen.

 PELVIS:  The previously described left pelvis mass appears increased in size
 compared to previous study, although given lack of IV contrast is ill-defined
 in.  It continues to appear intimately associated with the neighboring loop of
 bowel.  Additionally, oral contrast is seen in the vagina suggesting
 enterovaginal fistula.  A few small locules of gas are seen near the staple
 line of the Hartmann's pouch; it is unclear if intra- or extra-luminal.  The
 ostomy does not show any surrounding fluid collections.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 Multiplanar reformations provided multiple imaging perspectives for the

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter
 was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodules and
 known history of CLL.

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared
 to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most
 recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the
 spleen are persistent.

 There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate
 changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.

 Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.  The vast majority
 of previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground glass
 opacities have resolved or decreased in size.  On the other hand, multiple new
 but similar in appearance pulmonary nodules with center of solid density and
 surrounding ground glass halo have appeared:  4:36, 94, 109, 126, 143, 152,

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm

 COMPARISON:  MRI dated [**2121-5-15**], PET/CT [**2121-6-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the neck was performed with
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted
 within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in
 appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of
 midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the
 left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.

 There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the
 airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,
 consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue
 attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion
 cannot be excluded.

 The osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative changes noted
 throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6.
 Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 MRI/MRA/MRV HEAD

 MRI HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were
 obtained.

 PRELIMINARY READ:  ""acute infarct of the right talamus and internal capsule""
 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59168**].

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as a prior MRI
 of the head from [**2114-9-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There are new small infarcts involving the right thalamus and
 possibly the posterior limb of the right internal capsule.  These infarcts
 show increased T2- and FLAIR signal, which suggests that they are not
 hyperacute.

 There is encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right frontal lobe and the
 left occipital lobe.  The previously seen large left parietooccipital
 hemorrhage has essentially resolved.  The previously seen intraventricular
 hemorrhage has also resolved.

 There is a moderate subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter T2
 hyperintensity which likely represent combination of old infarcts and old
 small vessel disease.

 There is gyriform mineralization of the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe,
 right parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe.  There is siderosis lining
 the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally as well as siderosis
 of the inferior cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.  Mineralization along a
 right frontal shunt tract is seen.  There is stable old hemorrhage within the
 body of the right lateral ventricle.

 The previously seen left to right shift of the normally midline structures and
 mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle have resolved.  The ventricles are
 normal in size.

 MRA/MRV HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  3D time-of-flight images of the intracranial arterial system as
 well as oblique 2D time-of-flight images of the intracranial venous system
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as prior MRV of
 the head from [**2114-9-13**] and prior CTA/CTV of the head from [**2114-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:  There is new abrupt termination of the right posterior cerebral
 artery at its P2 segment which is new since the prior studies.

 There is decreased signal within the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral
 arteries bilaterally as well as the proximal portion of the basilar artery,
 not significantly changed since the MR from [**2114-9-13**].  However, the CTA from

 INDICATION:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, in another institution,
 recurrent chylothorax, repeated right pleural aspirates positive for
 triglycerides.  Left pleural effusion not aspirated.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.  Background of right mastectomy, right chest radiation and
 thyroidectomy.  Mild chronic renal impairment.  Low serum calcium, elevated
 serum phosphate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was
 performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for
 display in the axial plane at 1.25- and 5-mm collimation.  A series of
 multiplanar reformation images are also submitted for review.

 FINDINGS:  No prior CT is available for comparison.
 The patient has had a right mastectomy.  The thyroid is absent.  Mixed lytic
 and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, both anterior first ribs, medial
 clavicles, and many of the thoracic vertebrae are extensive, there is
 associated soft tissue calcification anterior to the right sternoclavicular
 joint.  The thoracic spine is scoliotic.  Exuberant calcification of the
 thoracic and abdominal aorta, the innominate, left common carotid, and left
 subclavian artery origins, coronary arteries, and the right renal artery
 ostium is markedly severe.  A left pleural effusion is moderately large.  The
 right pleural effusion shown on the chest radiograph dated [**2184-8-3**] has
 completely resolved after chest drain insertion (2, 44), its side hole is
 within the pleural cavity.  Linear scarring in the medial aspect of the right
 upper lobe (2:14), most likely represents prior radiation therapy and
 subsequent cicatricial atelectasis.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower
 lobe is moderately severe.  Ground glass attenuation of the left lung is of
 uncertain significance and could represent lymphatic obstruction, as the
 function of the moderately large left pleural effusion.  The airways are
 patent to the subsegmental level.
 The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The upper
 esophagus is mildly dilated, which places patient at an increased risk of
 aspiration.  A focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess may
 represent calcified adenopathy.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of
 the upper abdomen, only to confirm normal-appearing adrenal glands and the
 absence of upper abdominal ascites. <question> Are there any lymph node enlargements?"	no_answer	focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess

 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made. <question> Are there any bleeding spots on head CT?"	subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique- coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra- axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion, anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space. There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma. No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure. There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved, though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on these 2.5 mm sections). The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with fluid in the aditus ad antrum	extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures
 bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns
 bilaterally.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal
 carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small
 aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and
 appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

 LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:
 There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

 The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be
 catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's
 breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels
 under general anesthesia. <question> How are the carotid blood vessels?"	small aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery	LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius
 without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not
 aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to
 the right coronary artery.  The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of
 disease.  The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease.  The calcium score
 was 0.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in
 the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible
 recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of

 COMPARISON:  [**2175-2-24**].

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is pleural thickening at the left base.
 Bilateral linear basal scars are noted as well.  A single subcentimeter
 pericardial lymph node is identified.  The heart, pericardium, and great
 vessels are normal.  The liver is without focal or textural abnormality.  The
 gallbladder has been removed.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are normal.
 The kidneys enhance symmetrically and are without hydronephrosis or stones.  A
 subcentimeter well defined low density in the midpole of the left kidney
 likely represents a simple renal cyst.  An NG tube is seen within the stomach.
 The proximal bowel is normal.  There is no intra-abdominal free fluid or free
 air.  Numerous small para-aortic lymph nodes are seen, none of which meet CT
 criteria for pathologic enlargement.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is diastasis of the anterior rectus muscles
 with a small focal herniation of fat and bowel.  There is however no
 incarceration as the bowel is normal and contrast is seen passing throughout
 the loop of bowel.  Contrast passes all the way into the rectum.  The

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior
 surgeries.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen. <question> What Is the spread of the neck tumor?"	large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible.

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet from ground.
 Patient with abdominal pain and nausea.

 COMPARISON:  Trauma chest radiograph performed at 4:04 p.m.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis after administration of 130 mL of IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reformatted
 images were then obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels appear intact.  No
 pericardial or pleural effusion is seen.  Aside from dependent atelectasis,
 the lungs appear clear.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is seen.  No
 lymphadenopathy is noted.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is free fluid of intermediate density in
 the perihepatic and perisplenic spaces as well as along both paracolic
 gutters.  In addition slightly higher density fluid is noted within the
 mesentery in the mid-to-lower abdomen, between loops of small bowel.  These
 findings are consistent with mesenteric injury and concerning for small bowel
 injury.  No free air is noted within the abdomen.

 The liver, gallbladder and pancreas appear intact.  Small linear hypolucency
 in the posterior spleen is noted, and while this may represent a grade 1
 laceration of the spleen, this could also represent a splenic cleft; a
 laceration of this size within the spleen would not account for the extent of
 hemoperitoneum.

 The adrenal glands, kidneys and ureters appear intact.  The abdominal aorta
 and major abdominal arteries appear intact.  The non-opacified stomach and
 colon appear unremarkable.  No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting CT size
 criteria for adenopathy.
 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Air is noted within the decompressed urinary
 bladder, with Foley catheter in place.  The prostate, seminal vesicles and
 rectosigmoid colon appear unremarkable.  Small amount of fluid tracks into the
 pelvis.  The iliac vessels appear intact.  No lymph node enlargement is seen
 meeting CT size criteria for adenopathy.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Degenerative endplate changes are noted at multiple
 levels of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.  However, alignment is
 maintained, and no evidence of acute fracture is seen within the spine.
 Indeterminate aged fracture is noted along the anterior right seventh rib

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior
 surgeries.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.
 The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU. <question> Are there any abnormalities following stenosis?"	extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side. Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.

 HISTORY:  Alcoholic with hematocrit of 15 and fluid noted on fast exam.
 Evaluate for intraperitoneal hemorrhage versus ascites.

 No priors are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,
 and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric
 and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration
 of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A
 small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild
 colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall
 thickening involving the transverse and ascending colon is present.

 A mild-to-moderate amount of free fluid noted within the abdomen and pelvis is
 in characteristic distribution for ascites.  The fluid measures predominantly
 simple and less than the Hounsfield unit measurement of blood within the
 aorta.  Prostate is unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
 present within the pelvis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are present.  There is
 multilevel degenerative changes noted within the lumbar spine with mild grade

 HISTORY:  84-year-old male with chest and shoulder pain.

 COMPARISON:  No prior study available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest without IV contrast followed by
 axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after Optiray IV contrast with
 multiplanar reformats.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  High-density material
 consistent with hemorrhage is present throughout the middle mediastinum
 insinuating between the great vessels and circumferentially around the aortic
 arch. A discrete collection of blood layers anterior to the pericardium and
 superior to the heart, consistent with an anterior mediastinal hematoma,
 measuring approximately 7.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 cm. A small amount of high- density
 fluid is also present within the pericardium consistent with hemopericardium.

 The ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.0 cm. There are extensive
 atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch with wall irregularity at
 this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and
 likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around
 the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or
 transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great
 vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left
 vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left
 common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and
 airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular
 aneurysm or rupture.

 Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous
 changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left
 pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent
 atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the
 lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).
 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of
 the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,
 and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic duct is top normal in
 caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in
 the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of
 intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are
 bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring
 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.

 There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is
 tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures
 up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic
 change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,
 these vessels and their major branches appear patent.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present
 within the prostate gland, which is enlarged.  The urinary bladder is
 distended with contrast.  There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of
 a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or
 obstruction.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are numerous sigmoid
 diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Wedge deformity of the L2 vertebral body is probably chronic.

    30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2189-8-26**]);
 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74% <question> Is there any sign of ischemia?"	reversible, mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation correction	mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2522**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**], the
 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line
 was removed.  A sterile dressing was again applied. <question> Was PICC placed in the desired location?"	positioned in the distal SVC	successfully positioned

    30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2189-8-26**]);
 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74% <question> How well is the blood supply to the heart?"	reversible, mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall.

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

"<context> HISTORY:  A 73-year-old male with history of thyroid cancer and dyspnea.

 COMPARISON:  MRI dated [**2121-5-15**], PET/CT [**2121-6-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the neck was performed with
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted
 within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in
 appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of
 midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the
 left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.

 There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the
 airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,
 consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue
 attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion
 cannot be excluded.

 The osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative changes noted
 throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6.
 Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral
 bodies. seen on prior PET/CT without evidence of abnormal FDG uptake.  No

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with Type II dens fracture on CT of the spine.
 For further evaluation.  The patient has right-sided weakness.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and STIR sagittal and gradient echo axial images of the
 cervical spine were acquired.  The axial images are limited due to motion.

 FINDINGS:  As suggested by history, there is a linear signal abnormality
 through the dens indicating fracture.  The fracture corresponds to a Type II
 fracture.  There is no malalignment seen at the fracture site.  The atlanto-
 odontoid distance is well maintained.  The spinal canal dimensions at C1 and

 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for
 right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours
 between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural
 hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side. <question> Is there any retrobulbar hematoma?"	crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof	crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity

 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet off the ground.
 Per trauma team, patient is neurologically intact.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 Limited views through the skull base show no gross abnormality.  Limited views

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Are the carotid blood vessels normal?"	moderate left and milder right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries	no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary

 Initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line.
 First, attention was made towards creation of a tract.  Appropriate
 measurements were made and the subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with
 epinephrine buffered lidocaine.  A small incision was made and the dialysis
 catheter was tunneled through the left chest wall subcutaneous tissue. The
 indwelling catheter was then aspirated removing all heparin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66**] wire
 was advanced through the indwelling lumen into the IVC.  The previously placed
 line was then removed over a wire and a 16 French sheath/dilator device was
 advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The indwelling [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire
 and dilator device were then removed and the dual-lumen dialysis catheter was
 advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Post-procedural radiograph

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's

 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries
 appear normal.

 TECHNIQUE:  A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.

 FINDINGS:
 Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**].  There is
 chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus.  Flow is seen in the
 internal cerebral veins.  The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the
 source images.  There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse
 sinus.  There are large right transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Segments of
 the sigmoid sinus are much less well seen than previously, likely related to
 artifact based on the source images.  A small amount of flow is seen in the

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter

 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> Was the PICC placed?"	tip positioned in the SVC	5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the SVC

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Is there any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage?"	right posterior parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the

 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x
 1.0 cm (2:64).

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 The long sheath is changed for a short 6 French sheath. The heparin is D/C.
 The sheath will be pulled with the aid of a Syvek patch in the PACU. <question> Are there any abnormalities following stenosis?"	extensive intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

 HISTORY:  Anaplastic thyroid cancer.  Restaging.

 TECHNIQUE:  Continuous axial images through the neck were performed without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is
 again noted as well as enlargement of the right ventricle consistent with
 right vocal cord paralysis. Extension of the mass into this region cannot be

 [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS:
 Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the
 procedure. The possibility of gastric versus duodenal perforation was a
 concern, and a CT scan of the abdomen was arranged for the following day. <question> Was the Gtube placed percutaneously?"	guidewire was placed through the needle into the lumen of the stomach	stomach was reinsufflated with air

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior
 surgeries.

 with intravenous contrast.  Coronal reconstruction images were also obtained.

 CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of non-ionic IV contrast were given.

 ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.  There is a large
 hiatal hernia.  Gallbladder is not visualized status post cholecystectomy. The
 liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, intraabdominal great vessels, adrenals and
 ureters are unremarkable.  The kidneys show symmetrical excretion of contrast,

 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior

 CT CHEST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for interstitial lung disease, patient with
 pulmonary hypertension.

 Comparison is made with prior chest x-rays dated [**6-29**] through [**2176-7-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  High-resolution CT through the chest was performed without IV
 contrast.  Images were acquired in end inspiration and expiration prone and
 supine position.  5, 1.25-mm collimation images and coronal reformations were
 reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels.  Multifocal
 areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes are greater in the right
 side.  The size of the pulmonary arteries that goes towards the area of
 ground-glass opacities have the same caliber as the ones going to the
 non-affected lung.  Subpleural interstitial abnormality in the left upper lobe
 has the appearance of post-radiation changes.

 A tiny calcified granuloma is in the right upper lobe (series 104A, 71).  A
 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (5, 25) is not calcified.  Tiny calcified
 granuloma is in the left lower lobe (5, 30).  There is no pleural or
 pericardial effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  Moderate calcifications are in
 the left circumflex, LAD, main left coronary, and right main coronary artery.
 Mild calcification is in the aortic annulus.  There is no mediastinal, hilar
 or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The main pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged.
 The right main pulmonary artery measures 30.5 mm.

 Healing fracture is in the lateral aspect of sixth left rib.  Irregularity in
 the distal aspect of the right scapula could represent an old healed fracture
 or a prominent nutrient foramen.  There are no bone findings of malignancy.

 printed static ultrasound images from from [**Hospital 28312**] [**Hospital 28313**] Hospital,
 [**Location (un) 28312**], MA, dated [**2122-7-14**].

 ULTRASOUND-GUIDED CORE BIOPSY, LEFT BREAST:  Preprocedure imaging again
 demonstrates an approximately 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the
 retroareolar left breast.  Targeted ultrasound of the left axilla was
 performed, demonstrating several normal-appearing fatty replaced lymph nodes.

 Following explanation of the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives,
 written informed consent was obtained with the assistance of a Russian
 interpreter.  A preprocedure timeout was performed using three patient
 identifiers.

 Using standard aseptic technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, under
 ultrasound guidance, multiple core biopsies were obtained of the hypoechoic
 mass in the retroareolar left breast using a 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded
 biopsy device.  A percutaneous clip was subsequently placed at the site of
 biopsy under ultrasound guidance.  The needle was removed and hemostasis was
 achieved.

 Post-procedure mammogram demonstrates accurate deployment of the percutaneous

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The

 under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's

 MR BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2121-7-11**]

 HISTORY:  Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma with confusion and change in
 behavior.  Is there evidence of metastatic disease?

 Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through the brain.
 Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo, FLAIR,
 gradient echo, and diffusion technique.  No contrast was administered.  No
 prior brain imaging studies are available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of metastatic disease on this non-contrast
 examination.  Note, however, that contrast enhancement is by far the most
 sensitive measure of the likelihood of metastatic disease.  If there is a
 concern of potential brain metastasis, a repeat examination with contrast
 administration is recommended.  There is no evidence of masses or hemorrhage.

 attending radiologist.

 PROCEDURE:
 1.  Initial spot fluoroscopic image.
 2.  Removal of existing malpositioned nasogastric tube.
 3.  Placement of a 5 French catheter into the stomach.
 4.  Placement of a 12 French percutaneous Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] gastrostomy tube and 3
 T-tacks.
 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.

 MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV
 Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient
 received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was
 obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of
 procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial
 fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube
 malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and
 under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used
 to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.
 Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was
 insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine
 administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was
 deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two
 additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used
 to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced.  Sequential
 fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French
 Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube.  The pigtail was formed within the stomach.  Contrast
 injection confirmed location.  The T-tacks were secured to the skin with 0

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter
 was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications. <question> How was the PEG tube placed?"	G-tube was placed over the wire.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 INDICATION:  Hernia recurrence.  Multiple hernia repairs.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-4-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT enterography was performed. Helically acquired axial images
 were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis after administration
 of 145 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary
 to patient's allergies.  CT coronal reconstructions were also obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases are clear.  The
 liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are tiny,
 hypoattenuating lesions within the kidneys bilaterally, which most likely
 represent simple cysts.  Patient is status post cholecystectomy. There are
 multiple surgical clips seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.  There is a
 hiatal hernia present.  There is diastasis recti within the upper abdomen
 without a hernia sac present.  There are small pericardial and mesenteric
 lymph nodes.  No significant lymphadenopathy is present. There is no free air

 INDICATION:  43-year-old female patient with recurrent ovarian neoplasm.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
 following the administration of oral contrast.  Intravenous contrast was not
 administered due to history of iodine allergy.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2193-1-15**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT THORAX:

 No suspicious pulmonary nodule is seen.  No other pulmonary abnormality is
 identified.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

 CT ABDOMEN:

 No focal abnormality is identified within the liver on this study performed
 without intravenous contrast.  The adrenal glands, pancreas, and spleen appear
 normal.  A small area of accessory splenic tissue is again identified adjacent
 to the pancreatic tail.  There is hydronephrosis of the left kidney and
 dilatation of the left ureter to the level of the pelvic brim, unchanged since
 the previous CT.  A right extrarenal pelvis is again identified.  No focal
 abnormality is seen in the right kidney. Several small mesenteric lymph nodes
 are again identified in the left lower abdomen (series 2, image 81), with
 largest measuring 10 mm x 8 mm diameter in comparison to 13 mm x 11 mm on
 prior scan. Although this study was performed without intravenous contrast,
 apparent narrowing of the celiac artery at its origin from the aorta (series

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x

 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural

 The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
 was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under 1% Lidocaine local
 anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19-gauge
 needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta through
 the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 7 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4740**] catheter,
 which was advanced over the wire into the ascending aorta with the tip just
 above the aortic valve.  An aortogram was performed in RPO and LPO projections
 respectively with injection of nonionic contrast.  The aortogram demonstrated
 a normal appearing ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta, all
 major branches from the arch, as well as bilateral internal mammary arteries.
 The left common carotid artery has a common origin with brachiocephalic
 artery. There is no evidence of contrast extravasation, irregularity or

 CMR Technical Information:
 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
 2) Function: Breath-hold cine Steady-state free precession (SSFP) images were
 acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis,
 contiguous short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the
 left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
 4) Perfusion/Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
 segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition, short-axis, four chamber and
 two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
 total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 Magnevist  solution).


 Findings:
 The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.

 Structure and Function
 There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial
 fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal
 intensity.  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small
 (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were
 identified in their customary positions.  The diameters of the ascending
 aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal.  The left
 atrial AP dimension was mildly increased.  The left atrial dimensions in the
 4-chamber view was mildly increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged.  The left
 ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated.  The
 calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%,
 with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global
 hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of
 the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricular mass was normal.
 The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated
 right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional
 and global systolic function.
 The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.

 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
 significant aortic regurgitation.  There was no significant mitral
 regurgitation.  The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow
 demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.

 Viability
 There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal
 portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral
 segments, and the apex.   The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with
 poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.
  The infarct/LV mass ratio was 0.33. <question> Do we see any fibrous tissue in the walls of the heart?"	myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity	no_answer

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, in another institution,
 recurrent chylothorax, repeated right pleural aspirates positive for
 triglycerides.  Left pleural effusion not aspirated.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.  Background of right mastectomy, right chest radiation and
 thyroidectomy.  Mild chronic renal impairment.  Low serum calcium, elevated
 serum phosphate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was
 performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for
 display in the axial plane at 1.25- and 5-mm collimation.  A series of
 multiplanar reformation images are also submitted for review.

 FINDINGS:  No prior CT is available for comparison.
 The patient has had a right mastectomy.  The thyroid is absent.  Mixed lytic
 and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, both anterior first ribs, medial
 clavicles, and many of the thoracic vertebrae are extensive, there is
 associated soft tissue calcification anterior to the right sternoclavicular
 joint.  The thoracic spine is scoliotic.  Exuberant calcification of the
 thoracic and abdominal aorta, the innominate, left common carotid, and left
 subclavian artery origins, coronary arteries, and the right renal artery
 ostium is markedly severe.  A left pleural effusion is moderately large.  The
 right pleural effusion shown on the chest radiograph dated [**2184-8-3**] has
 completely resolved after chest drain insertion (2, 44), its side hole is
 within the pleural cavity.  Linear scarring in the medial aspect of the right
 upper lobe (2:14), most likely represents prior radiation therapy and
 subsequent cicatricial atelectasis.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower
 lobe is moderately severe.  Ground glass attenuation of the left lung is of
 uncertain significance and could represent lymphatic obstruction, as the
 function of the moderately large left pleural effusion.  The airways are
 patent to the subsegmental level.
 The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The upper
 esophagus is mildly dilated, which places patient at an increased risk of
 aspiration.  A focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess may
 represent calcified adenopathy.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of
 the upper abdomen, only to confirm normal-appearing adrenal glands and the
 absence of upper abdominal ascites. <question> Is there swelling of the lymph nodes?"	no_answer	focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 Bone windows show degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, bilateral
 L5 pars defects and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  A compression

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.

 conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously
 under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then
 performed, and radiographic images were obtained. The final images demonstrate
 the locking loop mechanism to be projecting over the third portion of the
 duodenum, with the tip of the catheter well into the jejunum beyond the
 ligament of Treitz. There is contrast material visualized in the body of the
 stomach and no extravasation. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's
 skin using 0 Prolene suture material. A Flexi-Track dressing was applied, and
 sterile gauze applied over the entry site.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple CT abdomen and pelvis with latest on [**2193-8-29**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis after only administration of oral contrast.  No IV contrast was
 administered secondary to patient's acute renal failure.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  The visualized lung bases are clear
 without pleural effusions.  The absence of IV contrast significantly limits
 evaluation of intra-abdominal organs.  The liver is noted with a geographic
 hypodensity in segment V, incompletely assessed, but grossly unchanged
 compared to the study 7 days ago.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted with small amount of hyperdense material
 layering in the dependent portion, compatible with gallstone.  There is no CT
 evidence of acute cholecystitis.  The adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen is
 grossly unremarkable.  The splenic vein is markedly calcified.

 Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is moderate-to-severe but relatively unchanged
 in severity compared to prior.  The stomach, duodenum and proximal loops of
 small bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is free oral contrast passage
 through and reaching up to the mid descending colon.  There is no free air or
 air in the intra-abdominal cavity.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is marked interval increase and spread
 of subcutaneous air along the left posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with
 interval aggressive necrosis of the underlying soft tissues.  Hyperdense
 material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64,
 concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent
 bowel.  Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also
 suggestive of microperforation.  There is no definite bowel obstruction.

 subcutaneous and intraperitoneal air.  The T fasteners continued to anchor the
 anterior gastric wall to the anterior abdominal wall, but due to the presence
 of intraperitoneal air, are under a significant amount of tension.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the CT
 scanner, and selective upper abdominal images were obtained, demonstrating
 pneumoperitoneum.  The skin was then cleansed and draped, and under CT
 fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge needle was placed just to the left of
 midline.  A 0.035 guide wire was then placed through the needle, and the
 needle was exchanged for a 4-French SOS Omni catheter.  Several 60 cc syringes
 of air were then removed under a three-way stop-cock system.  Images obtained
 through the upper abdomen following removal demonstrated a significant
 reduction in the amount of free air.  The anterior wall of the stomach is
 nearly adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall, with the degree of tension
 placed on the T fasteners significantly decreased.  A small-to-moderate amount

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time. <question> Is there any obstruction found within the carotid arteries?"	carotid arteries are patent	no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the internal carotid artery through either carotid canal

 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status

 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Large right complex cystic thyroid mass.

 PROCEDURE:  Ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration and fine needle aspiration.

 PHYSICIANS:  [**Location (un) 2813**], [**Doctor Last Name 26267**].

 PROCEDURE NOTE:  Following a discussion of the risks, benefits and
 alternatives of the procedure, informed written consent was obtained.  A
 timeout procedure was performed utilizing three patient identifiers.  Limited
 ultrasound of the right neck was performed for localization purposes.  The
 skin was cleansed with alcohol solution, and 1% buffered lidocaine was used
 for local anesthetic.  Under direct ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge spinal
 needle was advanced into the cystic portion of the right thyroid nodule, and
 approximately 3 cc of fluid was removed.  Further cyst aspiration was
 difficult due to the complex nature of the cyst.  Subsequently, fine needle
 aspiration x3 was performed of the more nodular superficial components
 utilizing a 27-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, with
 no immediate complications.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2813**] was present for the entire procedure. <question> What is the size of the thyroid mass?"	no_answer	Large right complex cystic thyroid mass

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius

 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,
 and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric
 and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration
 of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A
 small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild
 colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1090**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 713**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 714**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 714**] is the attending
 radiologist who supervised the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A consent was obtained from patient's daughter after
 explaining the procedure and complications.  Patient was brought to the
 angiography suite, intubated, and sedated.  Patient was placed supine on the
 angiography table and right side of neck as well as existing catheter prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed.  An initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate position of
 the existing line.  After appropriate measurements were made, a subcutaneous
 tunnel was created from right anterior chest wall to the skin entry site of
 the existing catheter.  A 14 French AngioDynamics catheter measuring 19 cm
 tip-to-cuff is pulled through the tunnel, exiting at site of the pre-existing
 catheter.  Both ports of the original catheter were aspirated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire
 was advanced through one of the ports into the IVC.  The existing line was
 then removed over the [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and a peel-away sheath advanced over the wire
 under fluoroscopic guidance.  The [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and inner dilator were then
 removed.  The double-lumen HD catheter was then advanced through the peel-away
 sheath and the sheath removed.  Post-procedural chest x-ray demonstrated
 appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with tip positioned in the
 right atrium.  Both ports aspirated and flushed easily.  The skin incision
 over the venopuncture site closed with 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter anchored to
 the skin with 0-silk sutures.  Sterile dressings were applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate complications. <question> Is the tunnelled catheter placement satisfactory?"	appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with tip positioned in the right atrium	patient tolerated the procedure well

 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for
 right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours
 between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural
 hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side. <question> Is there evidence of retrobulbar hematoma?"	crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof	crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst

 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during and after
 the uneventful administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 mL) of gadolinium-DTPA.  900
 mL of VoLumen was also administered orally.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformats and subtraction images provided multiple
 perspectives for the dynamic series.

 INDICATION:  A large pelvic mass (10:45)measuring 8.4 (AP) x 9.8 (CC) x 7.6
 (ML) cm from 8.1 (AP) x 5 (ML) x 7.1 (CC) cm [**2192-12-4**] becomes confluent with

 ileum causing an irregular lumen consistent with bowel wall invasion.  This
 lesion abuts and also likely involves the rectal wall (201:73).  There is near

 HISTORY:  43-year-old female with ovarian cancer and colostomy, now with
 nausea, vomiting, and chills.

 STUDY:  Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis; coronal and sagittal
 reformatted images were also generated.

 COMPARISON:  [**2193-4-30**].

 FINDINGS:  The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appear unremarkable.

 In this limited non-contrast study, again is seen in segment V of the liver an
 area of hypodensity measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.6 cm.  The liver shows no
 evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Within the gallbladder, there is
 dense layering material most consistent with sludge.  The spleen is normal in
 size and appearance.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Both
 kidneys demonstrate marked hydronephrosis that appears unchanged from previous
 study.  Contrast is noted throughout the small bowel and most of the proximal
 colon that does not quite reach the ostomy.  Within the opacified region of
 bowel loops, no evidence of obstruction is seen.  No free air or free fluid is
 seen.

 PELVIS:  The previously described left pelvis mass appears increased in size
 compared to previous study, although given lack of IV contrast is ill-defined
 in.  It continues to appear intimately associated with the neighboring loop of
 bowel.  Additionally, oral contrast is seen in the vagina suggesting
 enterovaginal fistula.  A few small locules of gas are seen near the staple
 line of the Hartmann's pouch; it is unclear if intra- or extra-luminal.  The
 ostomy does not show any surrounding fluid collections.

 heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within
 normal limits.  There is similar flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggesting
 hyperinflation that may be related to obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Bilaterally, nipple shadows are again seen, not significantly changed since
 the prior study.  There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 lungs are clear aside from a small degree of atelectasis associated with a
 prominent anterior osteophyte along the lower thoracic spine.  Barium outlines

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 Limited views through the skull base show no gross abnormality.  Limited views
 through the lung apices show mild dependent atelectasis. <question> What does the cervical spine look like?"

 INDICATION:  73-year-old man with right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy
 concerning for malignancy.

 After risk, benefits, alternatives and procedure were explained to the
 patient, written informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed using three patient identifiers.

 Initial ultrasound imaging showed three lymph nodes in the right side of neck,
 measuring up to 1.8 x 2 cm.  The middle of these was chosen for FNA due to
 size and relative distance from adjacent jugular and carotid vessels.

 The site in the right neck was marked, then prepped with alcohol.

 25-gauge needle was used to perform two passes of the FNA through the lymph
 nodes under direct ultrasound guidance (the first with suction and second
 without suction).  The material from the first pass was evaluated by on-site
 cytology team and was deemed adequate. The second sample was sent in cytolyte,
 as advised by cytology.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate post-procedure
 complications were noted.

 lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete
 collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging
 along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent
 hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.

 There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or
 axillae.  The heart and imaged portions of the great vessels are unremarkable.
 The ET tube ends at the level of the carina.  The NG tube passes below the

 HISTORY:  69-year-old man with persistent upper abdominal pain, nondiagnostic
 endoscopy and CT scans.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during, and after
 the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg.  In addition, 1 mg
 of glucagon was administered IM to reduce bowel motion.  The patient was
 administered 900 mL of oral contrast to facilitate evaluation of the small
 bowel.

 FINDINGS:

 Oral contrast is seen throughout the small bowel.  There is no separation of
 bowel loops, no abnormal mucosal thickening or enhancement.  No persistent
 strictures.  No mesenteric adenopathy.  Evaluation of the large bowel is
 somewhat limited by the residual fecal material; however, no gross

 INDICATION:  Aortic intramural hematoma, evaluate for growth of intramural
 hematoma.

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x
 1.0 cm (2:64).

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.  Clips
 are seen in the sigmoid.  There is no free fluid.  Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes
 measure up to 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right (2:113) and 1.8 x 4.3 cm at the left
 pelvic sidewall (2:108).  There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 who was present and supervised during whole procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Placement of temporary hemodialysis catheter.

 ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After risks and benefits of the procedure as well as
 local anesthesia were explained, informed consent was obtained.  The patient
 was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
 The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture
 needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hard copies of the ultrasound were
 stored.  A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using
 flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the
 needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The
 wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035
 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC.  The 4.5
 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was
 placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ.  The
 dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary
 hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the
 left IJ with the tip eventually terminated in the right atrium.  All three
 ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily.  The ports were
 capped.  The catheter was sutured to the skin and a sterile dressing was
 applied.

 INDICATION:
 83-year-old male with left pontine infarction with dense right hemiplegia.
 Long-term feeding required.

 [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS:

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    11.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2189-8-26**]);
    30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2189-8-26**]);
 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74% <question> Is there any dying myocardium seen on the cardiac perfusion test?"	reversible, mild reduction in photon counts involving the basal inferior wall.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2522**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**], the
 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet off the ground.
 Per trauma team, patient is neurologically intact.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen. <question> How is the neck mass on PET-CT?"	large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the level of the mandible.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate for interstitial lung disease, patient with
 pulmonary hypertension.

 Comparison is made with prior chest x-rays dated [**6-29**] through [**2176-7-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  High-resolution CT through the chest was performed without IV
 contrast.  Images were acquired in end inspiration and expiration prone and
 supine position.  5, 1.25-mm collimation images and coronal reformations were
 reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels.  Multifocal
 areas of ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes are greater in the right
 side.  The size of the pulmonary arteries that goes towards the area of
 ground-glass opacities have the same caliber as the ones going to the
 non-affected lung.  Subpleural interstitial abnormality in the left upper lobe
 has the appearance of post-radiation changes.

 A tiny calcified granuloma is in the right upper lobe (series 104A, 71).  A
 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (5, 25) is not calcified.  Tiny calcified
 granuloma is in the left lower lobe (5, 30).  There is no pleural or
 pericardial effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  Moderate calcifications are in
 the left circumflex, LAD, main left coronary, and right main coronary artery.
 Mild calcification is in the aortic annulus.  There is no mediastinal, hilar
 or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The main pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged.

 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from [**2170-7-17**], CT torso with
 contrast from [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the chest without the
 administration of intravenous contrast material and 5 and 1.25 mm axial slices
 coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm
 mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to
 the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small
 pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an
 immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement
 in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with
 only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right
 lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this
 exam.  However, there are multiple new nodules with surrounding halos since

 nodule (4:116) are new. In immunocompromise host, the new nodules with
 surrounding halos are concerning for fungal infection.  However, if patient is
 not immunocompromised, differential includes viral infection, new bacterial
 infection, COP or less likely vasculitis.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.

 INDICATION:  History of Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome with shortness of breath,
 desaturation, and tachycardia.  Evaluate for PE.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest without
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, axial images were
 acquired through the chest during administration of 100 mL of intravenous
 Optiray.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental
 levels bilaterally.  There is extensive atelectasis involving the right middle
 lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete
 collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging
 along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent
 hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.

 There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or
 axillae.  The heart and imaged portions of the great vessels are unremarkable.
 The ET tube ends at the level of the carina.  The NG tube passes below the

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along

 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2141-11-29**] at 12:58 p.m.

 HISTORY:  Assess chest tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of the right-sided chest tube
 with the distal tip directed cephalad and projecting near the superior margin
 of the mediastinum at the T5-T6 level.  The previously noted large right
 pneumothorax has been largely evacuated although residual remain with
 approximately 13 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation noted
 at the lung apex.  Similarly, a large left pneumothorax has also decreased in
 size though no chest tube is evident on that side.  The maximal visceral and
 parietal pleural separation on that side is approximately 7 mm.  Improved
 aeration results in decreased opacity at the lung hila.  Indwelling right
 internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are
 again evident and stable in course and position.  There is atherosclerotic
 disease of the aorta with evidence of prior CABG.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 within normal limits.  Retrocardiac opacity persists and pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded. <question> How severe is the pneumothorax?"	large right pneumothorax has been largely evacuated although residual remain with approximately 13 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation noted at the lung apex.

"<context> IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate mediastinal hematoma abutting the aorta.  While this
 may represent venous bleed given the intact appearance of the aorta, an
 angiogram of the aorta is recommended for futher evaluation.

 2. Dense dependent consolidations of the lung bases bilaterally suggestive of
 aspiration. Also multifocal opacifications with evidence of traumatic
 pneumatocele in the right upper lobe suggestive of pulmonary contusions.
 Multifocal pneumonia unlikely given the recency of the trauma.

 3. Moderate pneumothorax on the left inferiorly.

 4. Free fluid in the peritoneal cavity consistent with history of peritoneal
 lavage.

 This finding was relayed to the resident caring for the patient, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 14415**]

"<context> FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with worsening consolidations, to assess for
 change.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-2**], there is little overall change
 in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  Extensive retrocardiac
 opacification persists.  This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe that has not appreciably changed since removal of a mucus plug.  The
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.

 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the

 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made. <question> Is there evidence of bleeding?"	subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous emphysema.

There is extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on these 2.5 mm sections). The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with fluid in the aditus ad antrum	extensive acute hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these
 regions of T2 hyperintensity have an associated edematous characteristic.

 The left cerebellar hemispheric T2 hyperintensities appear to be relatively
 stable in extent.

 TECHNIQUE:  Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No discernable arterial vascular pathology is seen at this time.

 who was present and supervised during whole procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Placement of temporary hemodialysis catheter.

 ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After risks and benefits of the procedure as well as
 local anesthesia were explained, informed consent was obtained.  The patient
 was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
 The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture
 needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hard copies of the ultrasound were
 stored.  A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using
 flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the
 needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The
 wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035
 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC.  The 4.5
 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was
 placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ.  The
 dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary
 hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the
 left IJ with the tip eventually terminated in the right atrium.  All three
 ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily.  The ports were
 capped.  The catheter was sutured to the skin and a sterile dressing was
 applied.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in

 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely

 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the

 TECHNIQUE:  5-mm axial images from the skull base to the vertex obtained

 Comparison made to a prior CT of the sinuses dated [**2140-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  There is persistent pneumocephalus seen along the anterior frontal
 convexities.  Given that the pneumocephalus has persisted since the prior
 study on [**10-7**], the finding is of concern for perhaps a connection of
 the intracranial structures with the sinuses.  There is a small discontinuity
 of the inner plate of the frontal sinus, which could perhaps represent a

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.
 There is no lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted again

 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub
 centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
 Findings are in keeping with multiple  pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms
 and could be further evaluated with MRCP.

 patient's family and consent was obtained.

 The attending Radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 135**], was present during the entire
 procedure.

 The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
 was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under 1% Lidocaine local
 anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19-gauge
 needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta through
 the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 7 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4740**] catheter,
 which was advanced over the wire into the ascending aorta with the tip just
 above the aortic valve.  An aortogram was performed in RPO and LPO projections
 respectively with injection of nonionic contrast.  The aortogram demonstrated
 a normal appearing ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta, all
 major branches from the arch, as well as bilateral internal mammary arteries.
 The left common carotid artery has a common origin with brachiocephalic
 artery. There is no evidence of contrast extravasation, irregularity or
 aneurysm. The tip of the left chest tube is abutting the aortic arch. This
 finding was relayed to the ICU resident.  At the end of the procedure, the

 There is a 11 x 6 millimeter hypoattenuating left thyroid nodule (3:4).  There
 are borderline prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size
 criteria for pathologic enlargement.  For example, one in the AP window
 measures 6 millimeters (3:23).  A precarinal lymph node measures 8 mm (3:24).
 A subcarinal lymph node measures 14-mm.  There is no supraclavicular or
 axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 coronary vessels.  The heart size is normal and a small amount of pericardial
 fluid is present.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. They are non
 loculated and nonhemorrhagic.  On background emphysema, there are several
 ground-glass nodules, with a peripheral distribution, most concentrated in the
 right middle lobe.  The largest measures 10 x 5 millimeters in the right
 middle lobe (3:  34).  Another indistinct cluster can be seen also in the
 peripheral right middle lobe, measuring 12 x 11 millimeters (3: 39).  There

 consolidation with air bronchograms are present in the basilar aspect of the
 bilateral lower lobes (3:  46, 49).

 ABDOMEN:

 There is an 8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver.  The
 gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen appear normal.  There may be
 a tiny gallstone.  There are two subcentimeter right renal hypodensities, 1 in
 the upper pole and 1 in the lower pole, both of which are too small to
 characterize.  The there are no stones or hydronephrosis and the kidneys
 enhance normally otherwise.  The portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins are
 patent.  The abdominal aorta is heavily calcified but is of normal caliber,
 with patent main branches.  The small bowel appears normal.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  84-year-old man with COPD and respiratory failure, check Dobbhoff
 tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2129-12-18**].

 FINDINGS:

 A G-tube is seen ending below the diaphragm.  Cholecystectomy clips and an
 aortobifemoral stent is noted.  Visualized bones are unremarkable.  The
 bibasilar visualized lung bases are normal. <question> Where is the dobhoff tube placed?"	ending below the diaphragm	tip of Dobhoff tube at GE junction
"<context> FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup frontal bone fracture and evaluate for abscess.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-10-2**] and post-operative CT from [**2140-10-7**] and
 [**2140-11-15**].

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Again seen are metallic sutures fixating multiple
 comminuted fractures of the frontal calvarium.  There is discontinuity of the
 bone, with no osseous fusion of these fractures.  The previously seen
 pneumocephalus has resolved.  Bilateral subdural fluid collections have
 decreased slightly in size measuring 5 mm in greatest diameter.  There is a
 small osseous fragment within the subdural space.  The frontal sinuses are
 distorted and there is soft tissue and fat within the left frontal sinus.  The
 right frontal sinus is moderately aerated.  There is persistent mucosal
 thickening in the ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening in the
 visualized portion of the left maxillary sinus.  The visualized brain
 parenchyma is within normal limits, with no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or
 infarction.  The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.

 Again seen is non-fusion of the anterior process of C1 as well as rotation of
 C1 about C2.  While this may be positional, this finding has persisted over
 multiple CTs and is concerning for rotary subluxation. <question> Did the fracture on frontal bone fuse?"	no osseous fusion	no osseous fusion of these fractures
"<context> IMPRESSION:  Tiny left apical pneumothorax.

 administration.  Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**2106-9-11**].  There
 is worsening generalized sulcal effacement consistent with bilateral edema
 involving both cerebral hemispheres.  There is further evolution of the
 previously seen multiple punctate intraparenchymal and subarachnoid
 hemorrhages.  There is persistent dependent hemorrhage within both lateral
 ventricles.  Effacement of the perimesencephalic cisterns is seen.  No change
 is seen involving the position of the ventriculostomy catheter.  There is
 worsening mass effect within the posterior fossa due to possible cerebellar
 edema. <question> Does the brain parenchyma have any edema?"	bilateral edema involving both cerebral hemispheres	worsening generalized sulcal effacement consistent with bilateral edema involving both cerebral hemispheres

 HISTORY:  MI and CHF, now status post moderate diuresis with persistent
 hypoxia.

 Chest, single AP portable view.

 Compared with one day earlier, there has been significant worsening of the
 pulmonary findings.  There is now large area of alveolar opacification in the
 right upper and lower zones and at the left base, all worse compared with
 [**2120-12-27**].  There is minimal upper zone redistribution.  There are small to
 moderate bilateral effusions.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Osteopenia and

 INDICATION:  50-year-old female with left temporooccipital hemorrhage status
 post ventricle placement.  Evaluate for hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  Eight hours prior.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head.

 FINDINGS:  There has been slight shift of midline more rightward compared to
 prior study from eight hours ago.  The overall bulk of hemorrhage seen within
 the left parietooccipital lobes and ventricles is grossly unchanged.  No new
 foci of hemorrhage are identified.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There has been resolution of right lateral
 ventricular hydrocephalus since the prior study, presumably a result of shunt
 revision that also produced the small amount of intraventricular air. There is
 no evidence of new hemorrhage. <question> Is there any hemorrhage seen on head CT after ventric placement?"	No new foci of hemorrhage	bulk of hemorrhage seen within the left parietooccipital lobes and ventricles is grossly unchanged
"<context> IMPRESSION:

 1.  Status post right hemicolectomy, with unremarkable appearance of the
 ileocolonic anastomosis, without evidence of local recurrence.

 2.  Interval resolution of a few pulmonary nodules.  Few remaining sub-5-mm
 pulmonary nodules in both lungs are non-specific and are either unchanged or
 slightly smaller since the prior study.  Recommended followup chest CT in six
 months to assess interval change.

 3.  A stable 8-mm focus of enhancement within segment VII of the liver likely
 represents a flash-filling hemangioma or an FNH.

 4.  No evidence of new metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 INDICATION:  Status post myocardial infarction, persistent fevers, on
 antibiotics, positive sputum cultures, evaluate for pneumonia.

 Comparison is made to the AP chest radiograph from [**2162-4-5**].

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is stable cardiomegaly with bilateral
 subpulmonic pleural effusions and blurring of the pulmonary vasculature
 detail, indicating mild congestive heart failure.  The mediastinum appears
 wide, but is stable in appearance, likely from vascular engorgement.  Patchy
 areas of atelectasis are present within both lung bases.  No pneumonic
 consolidations are present.  Osseous structures are unchanged. <question> Do we see any infiltrates in the lungs?"	blurring of the pulmonary vasculature detail	No pneumonic consolidations
