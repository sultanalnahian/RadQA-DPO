 INDICATION:  Gastric cancer.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast helical scanning of the liver was performed.  Helical
 scanning of the torso was performed after administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
 Nonionic contrast was used because of history of multiple allergies.

 CHEST CT W/CONTRAST:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy.
 There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 present.  The esophagus is dilated, filled with food.  There is dependent
 atelectasis in both lungs.  Small pleural blebs are present at the lung bases.
 There are no focal consolidations to suggest aspiration.  There are no lung
 nodules or masses.  No destructive lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the
 osseous structures of the torso.

 ABDOMEN CT W/WO CONTRAST:  On series 3, image 14, there is a 2 mm low
 attenuation lesion in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe which is
 too small to characterize.  No other focal liver lesions are seen.  There is
 no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No abnormality is seen in the
 gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, or kidneys.  The kidneys show
 symmetric nephrograms and excretion.  The visualized ureters have normal

 SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a dose of
 approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  The patient experienced no angina.  ECG is
 uninterpretable in the presence of left bundle branch block.

 HISTORY:  Seventy-three year old male with gastric carcinoma, CAD, hypertension,
 peripheral vascular disease, for pre-surgical cardiac assessment.

 INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion,
 MIBI was administered IV.

 Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
 Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Stress and resting perfusion images show a mild reversible inferior wall
 perfusion defect.  There is mild LV enlargement on the stress images compared
 with the resting images.

 Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
 Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
 approximately 45%.  There is global hypokinesis which is more pronounced at the
 inferior wall and inferoseptal region. <question> Does the cardiac muscle show any ischemia?"	"mild reversible inferior wall

 INDICATION:  Small bowel obstruction, blood in stool.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of intravenous
 contrast.

 CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of Optiray was administered per patient
 request.

 CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST: There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is
 right lower lobe bronchiectasis.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left
 lung base.  The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No
 focal lesions are present.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
 An NG tube is present within the stomach.  In the upper portion of the spleen
 there is a 2.9 cm x 4.7 cm area of low attenuation  likely due to splenic
 infarct. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Multiple
 diverticula are noted throughout the colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
 The barium within the colon is present from the previous video swallow
 examination.  The barium within the small bowel does not pass through the
 entirety of the small bowel.  There are multiple dilated fluid filled proximal
 loops of small bowel. Within the right lower quadrant there are several
 collapsed loops of small bowel.  There is no free fluid or free air within the
 abdomen. There is no significant adenopathy.  There is a 6.9-cm abdominal
 aortic aneurysm with thrombus surrounding the aortic lumen. There is no
 evidence of dissection. Calcification are present surrounding the periphery of
 the aneurysm.  The aneurysm displaces the duodenum anteriorly and the IVC to
 the right.  The aneurysm extends from the level of the celiac axis to the
 iliac bifurcation. The renal arteries are superior to the aneurysm.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple diverticula are noted
 without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a 3-cm segment of small bowel
 which demonstrates thickening and surrounding fat stranding. Small gas
 collections are present in this region but the intra- versus extraluminal
 nature is uncertain. This region is the probable zone of transition. There is
 no free fluid within the pelvis. Foley catheter is present within the urinary
 bladder.

 INDICATION:  A 57-year-old male patient with hypertension and dyslipidemia,
 awoke [**2170-7-11**] with chest discomfort and catheterization demonstrated left
 main and triple vessel coronary artery disease.  Now scheduled for bypass
 surgery on [**2170-7-16**].  Preoperative chest examination required.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in
 upright position.  The heart size is normal.  No configuration abnormality is
 identified.  Thoracic aorta mildly widened, but no local contour abnormalities
 are present and no wall calcifications can be identified.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  No signs of acute pulmonary infiltrates are
 seen and the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  There exists a
 moderately increased depth diameter of the thoracic cage, which includes a
 moderately accentuated kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine with moderate
 degenerative changes, but no evidence of true vertebral body compression.  No
 other skeletal abnormalities are seen.  Within the heart shadow, no conclusive

 for the entirety of the procedure and supervised Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71035**].

 CONTRAST:  160 cc of non-ionic contrast was utilized.  Non-ionic contrast
 utilized secondary to the patient's history of multiple allergies.

 TECHNIQUE:  Informed written consent was obtained prior to beginning the
 procedure.  The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table.  The
 patient's right groin was prepped with Betadine.  A sterile field was erected.

 Double-wall technique was utilized to access the right femoral artery.  A J
 wire was advanced to the level of L1 within the aorta.

 The needle was removed over the wire.  A 4-French sheath was placed over the
 wire.

 A 4-French Omni Flush catheter was advanced over the wire.  Hand injection
 demonstrated normal arterial anatomy.  A power injection angiogram
 demonstrated normal origins of the celiac axis, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 85**] and renal arteries.

 The Omni Flush catheter was replaced for a C2.  Selective catheterization of
 the SMA was performed.  No sites of bleeding were identified along the course
 of the SMA and its branches.  The C2 catheter was replaced for a SOS catheter.
  Selective catheterization of the [**Female First Name (un) 85**] was performed.  Normal [**Female First Name (un) 85**] angiogram was
 demonstrated.

 A second selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  Again, a normal
 angiogram was demonstrated.

 The catheter was removed.  The sheath was removed.  Pressure was applied to
 the groin for 15 minutes.  Following release of pressure, no bleeding was
 identified.  The right groin was cleansed and properly bandaged.

 The patient left the Angio Suite in stable condition.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2116-1-29**].

 COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest, [**2115-3-16**].

 INDICATION:  Lung nodules.  Recent treatment for COPD flare.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was
 performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for
 display in the axial plane at 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.  A series of
 multiplanar reformation images were also submitted for review.

 FINDINGS:  Several small, less than or equal to 5 mm diameter lung nodules are
 without change from the prior examination, including a 5-mm right lower lobe
 nodule (151, 4) and several smaller nodules located in the right middle lobe
 (151, 4), lingula (153, 4), right middle lobe (41, 3) and left lower lobe (34,
 3).  Apparent partial fat attenuation in the periphery of the left lower lobe
 (156, 4) is likely unchanged but is difficult to directly compare due to a new
 area of adjacent consolidation within the left lower lobe.  Streaky
 peribronchovascular opacities are again demonstrated within the posterior
 segments of both lower lobes, and there are also new linear opacities within
 the right middle lobe and lingula.  Previously reported bronchiolitis pattern
 in right lower lobe has resolved.  Areas of bronchial wall thickening persist
 in the posterior segments of both lower lobes and are now associated with
 areas of peribronchiolar consolidation within the left lower lobe.  Upper
 lobe-predominant emphysema, moderate in severity, is again demonstrated.

 No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified.  Heart size is
 normal.  Small amount of pericardial fluid is slightly changed in distribution
 but unchanged in amount since the prior CT.  A small hiatal hernia is again
 demonstrated.  New trace left pleural effusion has developed.

 Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but adrenal
 glands are well visualized and normal in appearance.  Remaining imaged upper
 abdomen is remarkable for previous cholecystectomy.

 Skeletal structures are remarkable for healed right rib fractures. <question> Did the nodules change in size , shape or character in the past 6 months?"	"Several small, less than or equal to 5 mm diameter lung nodules are

 TECHNIQUE: On the 3T scanner, multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were
 acquired. Multilevel axial CINE sequences were acquired. Three-dimensional
 contrast- enhanced images were acquried before, during and after the
 administration of intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were used
 to evaluate the arterial anatomy.

 There is no evidence of dissection involved within the aorta. Multifocal
 penetration ulcers are identified throughout the aorta. There is no evidence
 however of focal intramural hematoma. The right common carotid artery is
 significantly tortuous. There is a 4.3-cm aneurysm of the descending thoracic
 aorta with areas of thickened atherosclerosis. This reaches its maximum
 dimension above the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. Bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.

 who were both present and supervising the entire procedure.

 INDICATIONS: This patient is a 79-year-old male with an asymptomatic 7-cm
 abdominal aortic aneurysm noted incidentally on a CT scan for a small bowel
 obstruction. He presents for aortogram with evaluation for possible endograft
 repair.

 MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received no IV sedation during the
 procedure, however was continuously hemodynamically monitored throughout the
 case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc
 of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.

 TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine
 position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and
 draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with
 the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine
 local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral
 artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the
 right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade
 and 0.035"" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the
 lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its
 side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the
 wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and
 abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter
 tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and
 left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed.
 Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was
 removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with
 manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure
 well. No immediate complications were noted.

 FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal
 celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single
 bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than
 the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is
 13 cm. The distance from the aortic bifurcation to the right iliac bifurcation
 is 8 cm.  There is about a 40 degree lateral angulation of the infrarenal
 aorta.  In the lateral view, there is mild posterior angulation of the
 infrarenal aorta.   The right iliac system is more tortuous than the left.
 Bilateral common internal and external iliac arteries are patent. The femoral
 arteries are also widely patent, as are the superficial femoral and profunda
 femoris arteries. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries have diffuse mild
 disease. <question> what is the extent of abdominal aortic aneurysm?"	"Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is

 TECHNIQUE:  A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed following
 administration of IV and oral contrast.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  A small amount of pericardial fluid is seen
 anteriorly and posteriorly with no evidence of loculation.  The pericardium
 enhances, but is not particularly thickened measuring approximately 2 mm.
 These findings are in keeping with the history of pericarditis.  There is no
 axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are seen with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  There are no intravascular
 filling defects with pulmonary arterial branches to suggest PE.  A non-
 specific density is visualized within the main pulmonary artery, of unclear
 etiology.  The central airways are patent.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The patient is S/P cholecystectomy.  The common
 duct is dilated to 12 mm, possibly due to ampullary stenosis; however, a
 retained stone cannot definitively be excluded.  Pneumobilia is likely related
 to a previous sphincterotomy.  There are no focal hepatic lesions. The liver,
