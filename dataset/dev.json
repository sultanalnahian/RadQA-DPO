There is increased T2 signal\n evident in the right posterior insular and portions of the right posterior and\n superior temporal lobe, consistent with infarction.  There is mild gyral\n swelling.  The ventricles remain normal in size and configuration.  There is\n no susceptibility artifact to indicate the presence of blood products.\n\n Scattered areas of microvascular infarction are identified in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 34**]\n nuclei and cerebral white matter, both on CT and MR examinations.  There are\n two small cerebellar hemispheric lacunar infarctions as well.\n\n Post gadolinium images are limited by patient motion, but no gross abnormal\n intracranial enhancement is seen.\n\n MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 501**] is limited by patient motion artifact.\n There is evidence of flow in the basilar artery and in both carotid arteries,\n but vascular evaluation is otherwise limited by motion artifacts.\n\n MRA of the cervical vasculature demonstrates flow in both cerebral carotid and\n vertebral arteries.  Again, motion artifact limits detailed evaluation of the\n carotid bifurcations and internal carotid arteries.  There are irregularities\n evident in the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally, some of which\n are clearly due to motion, but atherosclerotic narrowing cannot be excluded.",

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 539**], Staff Radiologist, was present\n for the entirety of the procedure and supervised Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71035**].\n\n CONTRAST:  160 cc of non-ionic contrast was utilized.  Non-ionic contrast\n utilized secondary to the patient's history of multiple allergies.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Informed written consent was obtained prior to beginning the\n procedure.  The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table.  The\n patient's right groin was prepped with Betadine.  A sterile field was erected.\n\n Double-wall technique was utilized to access the right femoral artery.

A 4-French sheath was placed over the\n wire.\n\n A 4-French Omni Flush catheter was advanced over the wire.  Hand injection\n demonstrated normal arterial anatomy.  A power injection angiogram\n demonstrated normal origins of the celiac axis, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 85**] and renal arteries.\n\n The Omni Flush catheter was replaced for a C2.  Selective catheterization of\n the SMA was performed.  No sites of bleeding were identified along the course\n of the SMA and its branches.  The C2 catheter was replaced for a SOS catheter.\n  Selective catheterization of the [**Female First Name (un) 85**] was performed.  Normal [**Female First Name (un) 85**] angiogram was\n demonstrated.\n\n A second selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  Again, a normal\n angiogram was demonstrated.\n\n The catheter was removed.  The sheath was removed.  Pressure was applied to\n the groin for 15 minutes.  Following release of pressure, no bleeding was\n identified.  The right groin was cleansed and properly bandaged.\n\n The patient left the Angio Suite in stable condition.\n\n COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications were identified, nor were patient\n complaints logged.",

Reformatted images were obtained.\n\n MR ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There are single renal arteries and\n veins bilaterally. There is a moderate ostial stenosis of the right renal\n artery. The left renal artery has an unremarkable appearance. Several small,\n subcentimeter simple cysts are identified within both kidneys. The visualized\n portion of the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are unremarkable.\n\n There is aneurysmal dilatation of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, measuring up to\n 4.4 cm.\n\n Multiple gallstones are present. The gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.\n The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.\n There is a focal area of increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images\n arising within the body of the pancreas. The pancreatic duct is of normal\n caliber. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is\n no significant lymph adenopathy. No bone marrow signal abnormalities are\n identified. There is diffuse edema within the subcutaneous tissues of the\n patient. There are also bilateral pleural effusions.\n\n MR reformations:  Reformatted images were crucial in delineating the above\n findings.\n\n KEYWORD: RENAL ARTERY",

Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was\n administered IV.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n\n Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.\n\n Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.\n Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.\n\n Stress images show a normal left ventricular cavity size.  There is decreased\n perfusion in the inferior myocardial wall, that reverses at rest.\n\n Resting perfusion images show no fixed myocardial perfusion defects.\n\n Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after\n Dipyridamole administration is 69%.

Recent treatment for COPD flare.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was\n performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for\n display in the axial plane at 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.  A series of\n multiplanar reformation images were also submitted for review.\n\n FINDINGS:  Several small, less than or equal to 5 mm diameter lung nodules are\n without change from the prior examination, including a 5-mm right lower lobe\n nodule (151, 4) and several smaller nodules located in the right middle lobe\n (151, 4), lingula (153, 4), right middle lobe (41, 3) and left lower lobe (34,\n 3).  Apparent partial fat attenuation in the periphery of the left lower lobe\n (156, 4) is likely unchanged but is difficult to directly compare due to a new\n area of adjacent consolidation within the left lower lobe.  Streaky\n peribronchovascular opacities are again demonstrated within the posterior\n segments of both lower lobes, and there are also new linear opacities within\n the right middle lobe and lingula.  Previously reported bronchiolitis pattern\n in right lower lobe has resolved.  Areas of bronchial wall thickening persist\n in the posterior segments of both lower lobes and are now associated with\n areas of peribronchiolar consolidation within the left lower lobe.  Upper\n lobe-predominant emphysema, moderate in severity, is again demonstrated.\n\n No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are identified.  Heart size is\n normal.  Small amount of pericardial fluid is slightly changed in distribution\n but unchanged in amount since the prior CT.  A small hiatal hernia is again\n demonstrated.  New trace left pleural effusion has developed.\n\n Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but adrenal\n glands are well visualized and normal in appearance.  Remaining imaged upper\n abdomen is remarkable for previous cholecystectomy.\n\n Skeletal structures are remarkable for healed right rib fractures.",

He presents for aortogram with evaluation for possible endograft\n repair.\n\n MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received no IV sedation during the\n procedure, however was continuously hemodynamically monitored throughout the\n case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc\n of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.\n\n TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine\n position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and\n draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with\n the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine\n local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral\n artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the\n right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade\n and 0.035\" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the\n lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its\n side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the\n wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and\n abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter\n tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and\n left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed.\n Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was\n removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with\n manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure\n well. No immediate complications were noted.\n\n FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal\n celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single\n bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than\n the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is\n 13 cm. The distance from the aortic bifurcation to the right iliac bifurcation\n is 8 cm.  There is about a 40 degree lateral angulation of the infrarenal\n aorta.  In the lateral view, there is mild posterior angulation of the\n infrarenal aorta.   The right iliac system is more tortuous than the left.\n Bilateral common internal and external iliac arteries are patent. The femoral\n arteries are also widely patent, as are the superficial femoral and profunda\n femoris arteries. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries have diffuse mild\n disease.",

The pericardium\n enhances, but is not particularly thickened measuring approximately 2 mm.\n These findings are in keeping with the history of pericarditis.  There is no\n axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  Small bilateral pleural effusions\n are seen with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  There are no intravascular\n filling defects with pulmonary arterial branches to suggest PE.  A non-\n specific density is visualized within the main pulmonary artery, of unclear\n etiology.  The central airways are patent.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The patient is S/P cholecystectomy.  The common\n duct is dilated to 12 mm, possibly due to ampullary stenosis; however, a\n retained stone cannot definitively be excluded.  Pneumobilia is likely related\n to a previous sphincterotomy.  There are no focal hepatic lesions. The liver,\n spleen, adrenals and pancreas are normal in appearance.  The kidneys enhance\n promptly and symmetrically with sub-cm bilateral low attenuation lesions which\n are too small to characterize.  There is no hydronephrosis.  Small\n retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.  There is no ascites.  The bowel is\n unremarkable.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is in place.  Evaluation of the\n pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from a right hip prosthesis.  A\n left common iliac artery stent is in place.  The patient has had previous\n bypass surgery in the left groin region with post-operative changes.\n\n Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates degenerative changes.",
